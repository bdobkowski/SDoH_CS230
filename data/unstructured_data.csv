We entirely agree with your diagnosis.  The tumor is best classified as a glioblastoma.  While the more spindled areas raise concern for hemangiopericytoma, lack of CD34 expression in the tumor cells provides no support for this diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate a malignant glial neoplasm composed of pleomorphic cells ranging from small, round cells to spindled cells.  The malignant cells have enlarged and irregular nuclei.  In the more spindled areas, the tumor cells have a streaming appearance and appear admixed around rigid, staghorn type vessels.  In other areas, the cells appear arranged around blood vessels.  Necrosis and vascular proliferation are identified. The tumor cells also infiltrate the adjacent grey matter. Immunohistochemical studies are performed, and the tumor cells are positive for GFAP which highlights shorter and thicker astrocytic processes.  Ki-67 highlights up to 15% of the tumor cells in some areas.  The cells are also strongly positive for WT-1 in the non-spindled areas.  CD34 highlights blood vessels but does not label the tumor cells.  Focal, weak expression of cytokeratin is seen in some tumor cells.  The tumor is negative for synaptophysin and CD45. CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year-old male with diagnosis of right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma and associated subdural hematoma with midline shift on 9/27/2009.  Pathologic examination showed glioblastoma.  MRI on 10/22/2009 showed postoperative changes with a right anterior temporal lobe mass.  He has received external beam radiotherapy and temozolomide.

MEDIASTINUM, ANTERIOR MEDIASTINAL MASS, RESECTION --   WELL DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR (ATYPICAL CARCINOID TUMOR), 2.5 CM (SEE COMMENT) LEVY/RUMERY/BERRY/VAN DE RIJN COMMENT:  The touch preps were reviewed and we agree with the previous diagnostic impressions. Histologic sections show fragments of nests that consist of round cells with granular nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells stain positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin and CK-Mix supporting neuroendocrine differentiation. We count 1 mitotic figure per 10 high power fields and focally necrosis is present. Due to the presence of necrosis, we favor classifying this tumor as an atypical carcinoid even though the mitotic count is less than 2 mitoses per 10 high power fields. Of note, the tumor was received previously incised in the gross room and while an attempt was made to ink the resection margins, artifacts of inking cannot be ruled out.  Tumor is present at ink histologically; clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended to determine the final margin status.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old man with a soft tissue mass on the left leg.  Dr. Edward Ellsworth refers a resection from the mass in consultation. COMMENT:  Thank you for referring this interesting and challenging case in consultation. We have reviewed five H&E slides and six immunohistochemical stains that pertain to an excision from a left leg mass (SP08-5820; 8/7/08).  Sections demonstrate a biphasic malignant tumor that is composed of relatively hypocellular areas that are infiltrated by markedly pleomorphic cells set in a myxoid stroma.  The stroma is punctuated by delicate arborizing blood vessels.  The hypocellular areas shows an abrupt transition to a markedly cellular and highly pleomorphic population of cells that are disposed in long intersecting fascicles.  The submitted immunohistochemical stains show that a significant subset of the more cellular population is reactive for smooth muscle actin; S-100, myosin, MART-1, CD34, and keratin are negative in the entire tissue sample.  We performed an immunohistochemical stain for myogenin, which is negative, providing no support for rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation in the more cellular areas. In conjunction, the findings are those of myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma. We do not accompanying areas of well-differentiated liposarcoma to classify this lesion as dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Dr. Richard Kempson has reviewed the case and agrees with our interpretation. Dr. Mattoch discussed the results of this case with Dr. Ellsworth on 8/19/08 at 11am.

Size of lesion is 2 cm. CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: pleura, left, ct-guided fine needle aspiration and core biopsy --   INVOLVED BY poorly differentiated ADENOcarcinoma (see comment) VOLARIC/PEPPER/HAMMER/LOWE DIAGNOSTIC COMMENTS:  The findings are compatible with involvement by a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with expression of CK mix, CK7, CDX2 and negativity for TTF-1.  The immunoprofile is not specific and may suggest metastatic involvement by an adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal or pancreaticobiliary primary; however, we cannot exclude a primary lung or other adenocarcinoma.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is needed. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The aspirate smears and touch prep slide reveals a malignant epithelioid proliferation with marked pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and nuclear contour irregularities arranged in clusters.  The core biopsy is concordant demonstrating pleomorphic tumor cells arranged in sheets and glandular structures. Immunohistochemistry and special stains reveal that the tumor cells express cytokeratin mix (AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2), CK7, CDX2 (patchy), Claudin-4, and Mucicarmine; and are negative for TTF-1, Calretinin, S100, CK20, P63, GATA-3, NKX3.1, SATB2 and WT-1.

ALARICE LOWE, M.D.   Electronically signed 12/16/2021 12:26 PM ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM NOTE:  The case has been submitted for mismatch repair protein deficiency testing by immunohistology. ADDENDUM COMMENT: Immunohistological studies for DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 demonstrate intact expression for all four of these enzymes in the neoplastic tissue.  These findings provide no support for loss of mismatch repair protein expression or microsatellite instability. Tumors that show no loss of protein expression for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 are less likely to be related to a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary cancer syndrome. These results should be evaluated within the context of a person's family history. Immunohistological staining for mismatch repair proteins is performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections, using standard protocols, using monoclonal antisera reacting with MLH1 (clone G168-728, BD PharMingen), MSH2 (clone FE11, Oncogene), MSH6 (clone 44, BD Transduction), and PMS2 (clone A16-4, BD Biosciences). Normal expression is defined as nuclear staining within tumor cells, using nuclei at the base of normal crypts (or infiltrating lymphocytes), as positive internal control. At the request of the treating clinicians PD-L1 testing by IHC was performed. The PD-L1 antibody, SP263 was used on the Ventana Ultra platform. The antibody was validated against the PharmDx 22C3 PD-L1 assay.   Both positive and negative PD-L1 cases were used in the validation process. The FDA-approved scoring scheme in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC): 1. HIGH  PD-L1 expression: tumor proportion score  (TPS)  ? 50%; 2. LOW PD-L1 expression: 1-49%; 3. NO PD-L1 expression: <1%. The evaluation of neoplasms other than NSCLC utilizes the same expression scheme although no specific expression cut-offs have been previously established. The tumor proportion score (TPS SCORE)  shows 0% positivity and is interpreted as NO PD-L1 expression. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Immunoperoxidase Laboratory.  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL, TUMOR RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV WU/TSAI/VOGEL COMMENT:  A preliminary diagnosis of glioblastoma was discussed by Dr. Vogel with Dr. Harsh on 1/23/2012 at 4 PM. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the patient's prior sarcoma (SHS-08-34749) showing a high grade pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma.  Histologic sections of the current specimen are morphologically dissimilar to the prior sarcoma, and show a hypercellular proliferation of pleomorphic cells arranged in nests and cords with prominent intersecting fibrovascular septae and eosinophilic, hyaline material. While some areas show nested cells with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, other areas contain larger cells with centrally-located round nuclei and surrounding cleared-out cytoplasm. Other foci contain cells with rhabdoid morphology. Vascular proliferation is prominent, and focal areas of necrosis are identified.  Lesional cells mostly exhibit a pushing front, impinging on fragments of intensely gliotic brain, though some areas are suggestive of an infiltrative pattern. Immunohistochemical staining shows that the cells express GFAP, confirming the diagnosis.  They do not express IDH1, and show focal p53 staining.  An MGMT methylation study has been ordered and the results will be issued in Epic.

Brain, right temporal, resection --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE IV C.  Brain, right temporal, aspirate --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE IV LUMMUS/VOGEL AMENDMENT COMMENT #1:  The diagnosis has changed from anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III to anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III on the bases of a normal result for 1p and 19q deletion FISH studies.  Further immunohistochemistry for ATRX and p53 were also wildtype for both genes. Thus the preponderance of the molecular results supports the change in diagnosis. Nevertheless, mutation analysis for IDH 1 and 2 remains pending and results will be issued in an addendum. AMENDMENT COMMENT #2:  Based on interinstitutional review, radiographic, and clinical correlation we believe this represents a glioblastoma despite complete representation of the histopathologic features.  Mutation analysis for IDH 1 and 2 gene mutation is negative for mutation.  Methylation-specific PCR followed by agarose gel detection for MGMT promotor methylation was negative.  Dr. Seth Lummus notified Dr. Sherif Makar of the final diagnosis on 12/21/16. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the intraoperative cytologic preparation and agree with the diagnosis.  FISH studies for 1p and 19q deletions are pending, and the results will be reported in an addendum.  IDH 1 and 2 mutation status is pending and the results will be made available in EPIC.  Due to the increased mitotic activity and enhancement by the radiology, we believe this tumor meets criteria for WHO grade III. Dr. Donald Born had reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections reveal a moderately cellular infiltrating neoplasm composed of monomorphic round cells with perinuclear halos. Delicate branching capillaries and microcystic changes are present. Focally, mitotic figures are elevated (7 per 10 high power fields). No necrosis or microvascular proliferation is seen. Occasional entrapped neurons are present.  IDH-1 (R132H) immunohistochemistry performed on block B1 reveals no cytoplasmic positivity (wildtype).

We agree with the diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, and furthermore that the tumor is the small cell variant of glioblastoma. By report, ancillary studies at UCSF revealed EGFR amplification in the tumor. The tumor was reportedly negative for MGMT promoter methylation in testing at UCSF. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections provided by El Camino Hospital demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm with cytologic anaplasia, increased mitotic activity and foci of microvascular proliferation and necrosis. The malignant astrocytes are uniformly medium in size, oval and demonstrate a very fine fibrillar background. Microcalcifications and chicken wire vasculature accompany the cytologic features and are consistent with the small cell variant of glioblastoma. The provided PHH3 immunostain highlights mitotic figures. By report (immunohistochemical stains performed and evaluated at UCSF), the lesional cells are negative for IDH1 (R132H), focally positive for p53 (25%), and positive for ATRX. Molecular studies for EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion were both positive. Studies were negative for both 1p and 19q deletions. Promoter methylation of MGMT was not detected.

Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 highlights some of the enlarged atypical nuclei present, approximately 3 per 100 of all cells (block B2). CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the Pathology Tissue Exam Request: 73-year-old female diagnosed with brain mass In the electronic medical record, Epic, we find Kazumi Anderson has a history of mild aortic regurgitation, osteoporosis, HLD and HTN and presented approximately 10-11 months ago with ear pain and headaches.  She was eventually referred to an ENT for further evaluation but no etiology was identified to explain her symptoms. Eventually MRI brain was completed on 5/28/21 and findings are concerning for infiltrative glioma growing in a gliomatosis-type pattern centered in the left temporal lobe. OPERATION: Left temporal brain biopsy ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block B2, which contains less than 5% tumor.

Regions of coagulative necrosis seen in the CUSA aspirate (part C) may be attributed to tumor necrosis or treatment effect.  MGMT promoter methylation testing is ordered and will be reported separately from the Molecular Pathology laboratory. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The histologic sections from specimens A ""septum ? tumor"" and B ""frontal tumor"" reveal brain parenchyma with areas of mildly increased cellularity due to an infiltrate by scattered neoplastic cells.  The presence of infiltrating glioma is confirmed by an IDH1 immunostain (performed on A2 and B2).  In addition, the sections from the ""frontal tumor"" (part B) reveal xanthogranuloma formation.  The histologic sections from the CUSA aspirate (part C) demonstrate an infiltrative neoplastic proliferation with associated microvascular proliferation and rare mitotic figures.  Patchy regions of coagulative necrosis are also identified. CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year-old male, history of recurrent GBM.  In the electronic medical record we find Jim Rodriguez had resection of right frontal glioblastoma in January 2014 with subsequent XRT and Temodar.

Although this immunostain will detect the most common IDH-1 mutation, a negative result does not rule out rarer IDH-1 mutations.  At the request of Dr. Sangoi, MGMT promoter methylation studies are in progress and the results will be reported in an addendum. Thank you for sending this case in consultation.  Glioblastomas with spindled morphology are not uncommon.  We agree with your interpretation that the positive GFAP staining and lack of intercellular reticulin in spindled regions is inconsistent with gliosarcoma.  Dr. Vogel has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate a glioblastoma with marked cytologic anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, endothelial hyperplasia and necrosis.  The tumor appears uniformly positive for GFAP, even in the spindled areas.  There is no significant reticulin staining spindled areas.  The tumor cells show strong reactivity for S100 and also demonstrate some cross-reactivity for mixed cytokeratins.

Edward Plowey, M.D. Electronically signed 7/27/2012 9:58 AM ***ADDENDUM*** ADDENDUM COMMENT:  This addendum is issued to report the results of molecular studies for MGMT promoter methylation which were performed on the paraffin block.  The final diagnosis is not changed. This specimen is positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. Interpreted by Iris Schrijver M.D.  Performed at Stanford Clinical Laboratory, 3375 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, Dr Dan Arber, Laboratory Director METHOD: MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. DISCLAIMER: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity.  Histology should be assessed by the referring physician.  It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

MGMT promoter methylation studies are in progress and the results will be reported in EPIC. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnoses.  Histologic sections from Part A show only rare infiltrating astrocytoma cells in cassette A1 (corresponding to the FSA1 received first from the OR) and glioblastoma with brisk mitotic activity, endothelial hyperplasia and pseudopalisading necrosis in A2 (corresponding with FSA2 received second from the OR).  Parts B and C show glioblastoma with many round nuclei and admixed frankly astrocytic nuclei with anaplastic features in a delicately fibrillar astrocytic background. The round nuclei in the tumor are interpreted as granular neurons and not a true oligodendroglial component.  This interpretation is supported by the observation of many entrapped Purkinje neurons and the presence of MAP-2 and synaptophysin immunoreactivity.  GFAP and EGFR immunostains highlight lightly immunoreactive, fine astrocytic processes in the tumor.  A p53 immunostain is not consistent with a p53 mutation.

Cultures were harvested and chromosomes were analyzed by the GTW method. Of 20 cells analyzed from 4 and 5 day cultures, all were abnormal. Five cells chromosomes representing a pseudodiploid clone were characterized by what is interpreted as a translocation between chromosomes #10 and #17[t(10; 17] and by undetermined rearrangements of chromosomes #3, #14, #19 and #22.  A second pseudodiploid clone of cells was characterized by a translocation between the long arms of #10 and #11 [t(10;11]. In addition to these clones, three other abnormal diploid cells and eight abnormal hypo-tetraploid cells were observed.  These diploid cells did not share common (i.e., clonal) abnormalities.  The hypo-tetraploid cells with chromosome counts of 81 to 86 did share some common abnormalities, but were so profoundly abnormal as to defy cogent analysis.  It is not clear that any of the hypo-tetraploid cells shared abnormalities with the recognized diploid clones. These findings are clonal in nature and, as such, consistent with a neoplastic process.  The two recognized cloned do not share common abnormalities indicating that a karyotypic level they are unrelated, possibly representing different clonal processes.  Interestingly, the different translocations observed in these clones, both involving chromosome #10, share the same apparent breakpoint at band 10q26.  The significance of this observation is uncertain. IMPRESSION: Abnormal clonal karyotype, consistent with a neoplastic process as interpreted by Athena Cherry, Ph.D. Cytogenetics, Director.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:   A 35-year-old male with history of astrocytoma with recent growth changes. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FS1: BRAIN TUMOR, LEFT FRONTAL, DESIGNATED DEEP MARGIN --   MARGIN INVOLVED BY TUMOR GEMISTOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA FS2: ADDITIONAL BRAIN TUMOR, LEFT FRONTAL --   GEMISTOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA (Jorden/Sobel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:   Received from OR ""Wilson"" labeled ""#1, superficial margin"" is a circular hemorrhagic tan piece of soft tissue, measuring approximately 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm.  It is entirely submitted in one cassette labeled A. Specimen #2 is received fresh from the OR labeled ""deep"" is a piece of tan soft tissue measuring approximately 1. x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. A representative section is taken and frozen as FS1.  The remaining frozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette labeled FS1.  The remaining unfrozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette labeled X1. Specimen #3 is received from the OR labeled ""additional tumor (FS2)"" and is a single fragment of brain tissue measuring 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm.  It is serially sectioned to reveal a thin gray cortex and white matter.  One edge is designated by the surgeon, and is a cyst wall composed of a softened tan area. A representative section piece of this area is taken along with normal appearing white matter opposite the lesion and frozen as FS2.  The remaining frozen tissue is placed in a cassette labeled FS2.  The remaining unfrozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette labeled X2A through X2D. Specimen #4 is designated ""superior posterior margin"" and consists of a piece of white soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm consistent with brain. One surface has numerous small specks of blood and clot. The specimen is submitted entirely in a single cassette labeled B. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of a glial tumor. Histologic sections of specimen #2 and #3 are similar in appearance and will be described together. These specimens show fragments of brain with tumor. This tumor has a fibrillary background and is composed predominantly of large cells with plump eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells demonstrate marked nuclear pleomorphism with occasional binucleate and multinucleate forms with multiple nucleoli. In addition, focal areas with endothelial proliferation as well as focal regions of necrosis are noted. Occasional mitotic figures can be seen (X2D). Occasional perivascular cuffing by mononuclear inflammatory cells is present. Histologic sections of specimens #1 and #4 were submitted as additional surgical margins and show involvement by tumor. COMMENT: The prior specimen (SHS-00-34929) is unavailable for review--was sent to another institution for a second opinion. While features consistent with a gemistocytic astrocytoma are present in the current specimen, more worrisome findings such as marked nuclear pleomorphism, anaplasia, endothelial proliferation, necrosis and mitotic figures indicate that the tumor has acquired features of glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV).

OPERATION: MRI stereotactic brain biopsy. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Brain mass. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FS1: BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL, BIOPSY --   MIXED OLIGOASTROCYTOMA. (Sundram/Lehman/Horoupian) GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh from the Operating Room, labeled ""#1 brain tumor,"" and consists of multiple fragments of red-tan tissue which measure in aggregate 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm.  A representative section is frozen as FS1 and subsequently wrapped in tissue paper and submitted for permanent sections in cassette FS1.  The unfrozen tissue is wrapped in tissue paper and submitted entirely in cassette X1.  Sundram/ck MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections of this scant specimen confirm the frozen section diagnosis of a glial neoplasm. The presence of a preponderance of cells with astrocytic differentiation over those with oligodendroglial differentiation is much better appreciated in the permanent sections.  A large proportion of the  neoplastic astrocytes show gemistocytic features.  The cells are large with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and eccentrically placed nuclei with small nucleoli. Nuclear atypia is minimal and mitotic activity is absent.  No areas of necrosis or microvascular proliferation are present.  The background consists of a coarse fibrillary network formed by stout randomly oriented processes.   Perivascular lymphocytic cuffing is not prominent. Immunohistochemistry: The plump gemistocytic astrocytes and their fibrillar processes are highlighted by GFAP, and focally up to 4% of the cells are highlighted by MIB-1.

The scant specimen makes it difficult to grade this astrocytoma; however, the lack of mitotic activity, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation are consistent with WHO grade II.

FISH studies for EGFR amplification are in progress and will be reported in an addendum. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and confirmed the intraoperative diagnoses.  Permanent sections from the biopsy in Part A reveal predominantly a reactive, granulation tissue background that is consistent with the frozen section; small foci show features consistent with involvement infiltrating glioblastoma seen in the subsequent specimens.  Specimens B-D demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, scattered mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplasm is positive for GFAP and S100.  An immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 stains 20-30% of the tumor cells in some areas.  A CD163 stain highlights the extensive associated macrophage infiltrate in the tumor and in areas of granulation tissue.  An immunohistochemical stain for the IDH1 R132H mutation (clone H09) is negative in the tumor (external positive control is appropriate).

A few mitotic figures and rare foci of microvascular proliferation demonstrating a double layer of endothelial cells are present, interpreted as sufficient for the diagnosis of glioblastoma.  There is no definite necrosis. A perivascular lymphocytic infiltration is also seen. Immunohistochemistry studies for IDH1-R132H, p53 and ATRX protein were performed on block 1C at UCSF Medical center. Per review of the report, the tumor cells are negative for IDH1-R132H mutant protein, have intact/ retained expression of ATRX protein, and approximately 10% of the cells are strongly positive for p53 protein. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for EGFR and PTEN were also performed in the UCSF Molecular Laboratory on block 1C (MOL14-1417 and MOL14-1418). Per review of the report, the tumor shows evidence of PTEN gene, (chromosome 10) deletion but no amplification of the EGFR gene.

The diagnosis previously issued was ""INFILTRATING GLIOMA, IDH1 R132H WILD-TYPE, PENDING MOLECULAR"" and the diagnosis is revised to ""GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILD-TYPE, WHO GRADE 4"". This is the only change in the report. Revised text is italics. DIAGNOSIS (MICROSCOPIC): A. BRAIN, BIOPSY (FSA) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILD-TYPE, WHO GRADE 4 B. BRAIN MASS, EXCISION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILD-TYPE, WHO GRADE 4 NICHOLAS/NIRSCHL/TOLAND/VOGEL COMMENT: The frozen section slides have been reviewed and we agree with the diagnosis rendered. The overall findings are those of an infiltrating glioma for which definitive classification is deferred pending molecular studies. Next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the UCSF 500 panel as well as molecular testing for MGMT promoter methylation have been ordered on block A2; the results are pending and will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Donald Born viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Parts A and B show similar features and will be described together. Histologic sections demonstrate a cellular proliferation of moderately atypical glial cells with abundant perineuronal satellitosis and a single mitotic figure. No definite microvascular proliferation or necrosis is identified. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the cells to be negative for IDH1 R132H (wild-type). CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old male with brain mass; Per EPIC: ""77 YO male who has a history of a stroke in  2014 with Right Hemiparesis now resolved, Type II diabetes, hypothyroidism, GERD, BPH, OSA, Aortic valve stenosis, PVD, HTN. Unfortunately, the patient in May 2021 suffered what was likely a right-sided mild stroke/TIA.  At that time, the patient underwent MRI imaging to further rule out additional causes besides his known prior stroke symptoms.  During that time, the patient was found to have a right-sided temporal T2 hyperintense lesion that was concerning for a glioma versus other inflammatory process."" OPERATION: Stereotactic brain biopsy CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Brain mass ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A2, which contains approximately 10% tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FSA: BRAIN BIOPSY      --   SUSPICIOUS FOR INFILTRATING GLIOMA; ADDITIONAL TISSUE REQUESTED.      (Nirschl/ Vogel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""brain biopsy (FSA)"" is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is partly frozen as FSA. The tissue is not exhausted.  The specimen is submitted entirely as follows: A1: Frozen section remnant A2: Remaining specimen The second specimen labeled ""brain mass"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple fragments of tan to tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette B1.  Rondeau   (9/13/2021) ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to describe the results of next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the UCSF 500 panel. MOLECULAR TESTING:  Samples from the neoplasm as unstained sections from block A2 were submitted to the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory. The findings are as follows: A. BRAIN, BIOPSY, MUTATIONAL PROFILING --   POSITIVE FOR TERT c.-124C>T PROMOTER MUTATION (VAF= 32%) --   POSITIVE FOR EGFR p.F254I MUTATION (VAF= 22%) --   POSITIVE FOR CDK4 AMPLIFICATION --   POSITIVE FOR MDM4 AMPLIFICATION --   TRISOMY CHROMOSOME 7, MONOSOMY CHROMOSOME 10 --   1 OF 85 MICROSATELLITES UNSTABLE (1.18%) --   TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN: 2.8 MUTATIONS/MB ADDENDUM COMMENT: All variants considered ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"" are reported here. Molecular profiling demonstrates the presence of a population of neoplastic cells with a TERT promoter mutation and chromosomal alterations trisomy 7/monosomy 10, which are molecular features diagnostic for glioblastoma in the absence of mutations of IDH1/2 (1-2). Other genetic alteration such as EGFR mutations and amplification of the CDK4 and MDM4 oncogenes are commonly seen in glioblastoma. For additional details on the variants detected as well as the full list of variants (including variants of uncertain significance) and methodologic details, please see the complete report. To incorporate the molecular findings, the diagnosis will be revised in an amendment. References: 1.

We agree with Dr. Moretto's interpretation of glioblastoma.  There is a predominance of relatively monomorphous small cells that is suggestive of the small cell variant of glioblastoma.  The provided slides show an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation with sheet-like growth.  The neoplastic cells are characterized by angular and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year-old male with right frontal brain tumor resected in February 2013.  We have received 8 slides from CPMC in San Francisco, CA.

In our opinion the provided slides are most consistent with glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Based on the available history this represents glioblastoma at the location of a prior resection that is reported as glioblastoma (slides not available for review).  Clinical correlation is required. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate cortical gray and white matter with a variably cellular infiltrative glial proliferation. The infiltrating cells generally appear as nuclei without cytoplasm although focally there are coarse processes.  The nuclei are moderately pleomorphic, many with irregular nuclear contours, hyperchromasia and coarse chromatin. We found focal microvascular proliferation but no definite necrosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year-old male with right temporal brain tumor excised in March 2013.  Accompanying pathology report indicates that a prior resection was performed in February 2013 was diagnosed as glioblastoma and was reportedly reviewed at UCLA (R13-8481) as compatible with glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  We have received 5 H&E stained slides from the March 2013 resection (S13-05864, B4 and B7-B10).   The addendum submitted with the slides from S13-5864 indicates that additional studies demonstrated positive staining for IDH1, MGMT promoter methylation study positive for methylation and EGFRvIII by RT-PCR was negative.

We have reviewed the outside materials and fully concur with the rendered diagnosis. In light of the patient's remarkable survival, it maybe clinically warranted to explore further molecular characterization, e.g. the IDH1 (R132H), ATRX and p53 status of the neoplasm. We are unable to perform these studies at this time, as a block has not been made available to us. The provided histologic sections reveal a neoplastic proliferation of malignant glia characterized by enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, and frequent mitotic activity. Both pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are readily identified. Per report, molecular studies performed on the outside revealed EGFR amplification; however co-deletion of 1p/19q was not found. Dr. Donald Born has seen the slides and agrees with our diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extracting from the electronic medical record, we note that the patient is a 64 year old man with a history of a left temporal GBM status post resection and Gliadel wafer placement on 03/02/2002. He has also been treated with multiple cycles of temozolomide and radiation. Currently radiologic studies reveal no evidence of residual/recurrent disease.

These findings provide no support for loss of mismatch repair protein expression or microsatellite instability. Tumors that show no loss of protein expression for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 are less likely to be related to a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary cancer syndrome. These results should be evaluated within the context of a person's family history. Immunohistological staining for mismatch repair proteins is performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections, using standard protocols, using monoclonal antisera reacting with MLH1 (clone G168-728, BD Biosciences), MSH2 (clone FE11, Calbiochem), MSH6 (clone 44, Cell Marque), and PMS2 (clone MRQ-28, Cell Marque). Normal expression is defined as nuclear staining within tumor cells, using nuclei of infiltrating lymphocytes or other non-neoplastic cells as positive internal control.

Lymph nodes, right axillary, lymph node dissection --   twelve lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/12) LIN/MARTIN/WEST COMMENT:  We have reviewed the frozen sections and concur with the diagnosis rendered. Sections of the left breast mastectomy (specimen C) contain extensive lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia, spanning 10cm (macrosections #8-#16). Two distinct foci of invasive lobular carcinoma are identified. The first focus, consistent with the prior-biopsied L1 lesion, spans 4.4cm (macrosections #13-#16). The second focus spans 2.2cm (macrosections #8-#9).While this two foci of carcinoma share similar histological features and are connected by lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia, we favor these findings represent multiple foci of invasive carcinoma. Lactiferous ducts of the nipple are involved by a spectrum of atypical lobular hyperplasia to lobular carcinoma in situ. Incidental hemangiomas are identified in the epidermis and breast parenchyma (slides C3 and C37). The panel for prognostic/predictive markers is ordered for L1 lesion, and the result will be reported in an addendum. If clinically warranted, the panel could be ordered in the second lesion as well.

HER2 FISH Scoring Criteria; Amplified: Ratio >2.0 or > 6 HER2 signals/cell. >6.0 HER2 signals/cell can be present with a ratio <2.0, if co-amplification is present. Equivocal: Ratio < 2.0 and 4.0 to < 6.0 HER2 signals/cell. The guidelines suggest counting additional cells for FISH, retesting on another block, or performing IHC on equivocal cases. Negative: Ratio < 2.0 and <4.0 HER2 signals/cell. Cases with ratio < 4.0 gene copies and ratio > 2.0 are considered positive but treatment considerations should include other features including IHC and clinical considerations. Results from the PathVysion  HER2 DNA probe kit (Vysis) are intended for use as an adjunct to other clinical and pathologic information. References: Wolff AC et al. JCO 31:3997-4013, 2013.

No tumor budding is seen.  No lymphovascular space invasion is identified.  The adenocarcinoma invades into at least the muscularis mucosa of the polyp. On the first two level sections, the muscularis mucosa is obscured by inflammatory reaction and desmoplasia in association with tumor, which raises the possibility of invasion into the submucosa of the polyp stalk.  However, multiple deeper level sections are not diagnostic for invasion into the submucosa of the polyp stalk; therefore the tumor is best classified as at least intramucosal adenocarcinoma.    Nevertheless the polyp stalk margin is free of adenocarcinoma, which is located 3 mm away.  No dysplasia is seen at the polyp stalk margin. Dr. Richard Hildebrandt has reviewed representative slides from part A and concurs. The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. John Gahagan on the afternoon of 8/29/2022.  A copy of the report is faxed to Dr. Gahagan's office on 8/29/2022. SOURCE DESCRIPTION: A. ANTERIOR ANORECTAL POLYPS B. RIGHT POSTERIOR ANAL SKIN TAG C.

These findings provide no support for loss of mismatch repair protein expression or microsatellite instability. Â  Tumors that show no loss of protein expression for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 are less likely to be related to a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary cancer syndrome. These results should be evaluated within the context of a person's family history. Â  Immunohistological staining for mismatch repair proteins is performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections, using standard protocols, using monoclonal antisera reacting with MLH1 (clone G168-728, BD Biosciences), MSH2 (clone FE11, Calbiochem), MSH6 (clone 44, Cell Marque), and PMS2 (clone MRQ-28, Cell Marque). Normal expression is defined as nuclear staining within tumor cells, using nuclei of infiltrating lymphocytes or other non-neoplastic cells as positive internal control. ADDENDUM : Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins are performed and evaluated at Stanford Health Care, Stanford, California (Stanford accession number: SHS22-37146).

The biopsy from the left breast shows a few small clusters of uniform small epithelial cells with the appearance of atypical lobular hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin demonstrate a complete lack of cell membrane staining supporting lobular differentiation. Immunohistochemical staining containing with CK5, p63 and CK 8/18 demonstrates a complete lack of myoepithelial cells around the small clusters of cells. The lack of myoepithelial cells around these clusters of cells is supportive of invasive lobular carcinoma. The largest focus measures 0.08 cm in size. According to the outside report estrogen and progesterone receptor are strongly positive, Ki-67 proliferation rate is 4% and Her2 Dual ISH is unamplified (HER2:CEP17 ratio 1.0). The biopsy from the right breast demonstrates nonspecific fibrocystic change. CLINICAL HISTORY: 73-year-old woman with a mass in her right breast.

LEFT FRONTO PARIETAL (FSA, TPA) C. CUSA ASPIRATE B. FLOW CYTOMETRY CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per Epic, the patient is a 65-year-old female who was in her usual state of health until three/four weeks ago when she started miss pronouncing words, and had difficulty and with writing and sewing.  An MRI performed 11/10/2008 showed a 4.5 x 5.5 cm partially cystic, partially nodular, presumably enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe. Her medical history also includes testing positive for tuberculosis without treatment and a history of uterine and cervical cancer in 1996 for which she underwent a radical hysterectomy followed by radiotherapy.

A portion is frozen.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is submitted in cassette A1.   The tissue that is not frozen is entirely submitted in cassette A2.   Velasquez for Neuropath/mkb A second container is received labeled with the patient name and medical record number.  The specimen, designated ""CUSA aspirate"" consists of a 3 x 3 x 0.7 cm aggregate of disrupted tan-red tissue fragments that are received partially free floating within the specimen container and partially within an aspiration sack. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes C1 and C2. Rapuano for Neuropath/mkb MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment.  Permanent sections from both specimens demonstrate similar features and will be discussed together.  These sections demonstrate a hypercellular tumor composed enlarged hyperchromatic cells with stippled, ""salt and pepper"" neuroendocrine-appearing chromatin. The tumor has a variable appearance, and in some areas the cells are arranged in somewhat cohesive clusters, while in other areas the tumor appears discohesive, and appears to be infiltrating gray and white matter. Focally, the tumor cells demonstrate enlarged nuclei, with nuclear wrapping and molding. Pseudopalisading necrosis and vascular proliferation are also identified. The morphologic differential diagnosis is broad and includes malignant glioma and metastatic carcinoma (given the patient's history of cervical carcinoma).  Due to the discohesive nature of the tumor on frozen section, we considered the possibility of a hematolymphoid neoplasm, however the morphology on permanent sections as well as the flow cytometric immunophenotyping argues against such a diagnosis. To further characterize the tumor, immunohistochemical stains are pursued.  The tumor cells are negative for CKAE1/AE3, CK7, CK20, and chromogranin. The tumor cells are diffusely positive for synaptophysin. S100 stains numerous tumor cells as well as dendritic cells. A GFAP stain demonstrates focal cytoplasmic positivity in tumor cells.

The majority of events are CD45 negative and exhibit high side-scatter, suggestive of a non-hematolymphoid process.  A significant proportion of events also bind to the CD56 antibody, while CD16 is negative.  These findings suggest a non-hematolymphoid process. However, if the histologic are more compatible with a hematolymphoid neoplasm, immunohistochemical and in-situ methods to evaluate for an NK cell neoplasm may be useful. Gating on lymphocytes (strong CD45, low SSC) shows very few events which are predominantly T lymphocytes. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .

A limited one-tube panel was selected due to scant specimen cellularity. No abnormal population is identified in any gate. The lymphocyte gate contains mostly CD5-positive CD19-negative likely T cells.  No detectable B cell population is present.  There is no increase in CD19-negative, CD5-negative cells within the gate. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.

We have reviewed the frozen section slides from this resection (specimens A and B) and agree with the intraoperative diagnoses rendered. The fixed tissue from specimen B shows predominantly necrosis with small areas of viable cells that we interpret as neoplastic glial cells, not adequately sampled at intraoperative consultation. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections from specimens A, C and D demonstrate a cellular infiltrating, glial neoplasm characterized by cells with hyperchromatic angular nuclei, coarse chromatin, variable (but generally small) amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and high nuclear/cytoplasmic. Numerous mitotic figures are seen. Pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are prominent. Histologic sections from the fixed tissue from specimen B demonstrate predominantly necrosis with small areas of viable cells at low density with moderately pleomorphic spindled nuclei and cytoplasmic process while lacking mitotic figures, pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular.

We agree with your impression of glioblastoma. There are areas with very primitive-appearing small cells such that we consider this to be a PNET-like component, a feature in glioblastomas that is reported to portend an increased risk of remote subarachnoid spread and CSF seeding.  As discussed with the contributor, a block has been requested and the IDH1 R132H mutational status and MGMT promoter methylation analysis will be reported in an addendum. Clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the diagnosis with Dr. David Gardner on 11/9/2018. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections demonstrate a proliferation of neoplastic astrocytes with marked cytologic atypia, brisk mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation with areas characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei that are closely packed due to the with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, imparting a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) appearance.  Areas of necrosis are also identified as is microvascular proliferation.  Fragments of infiltrated cerebral tissue are also noted. The provided Ki67 immunohistochemical stains demonstrate a high proportion of positive nuclei in the neoplastic cells which reaches up to 60% in the PNET-like areas. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56 year old female who presented hallucinations and headaches. Imaging studies revealed a right temporal enhancing mass measuring 4.1 x 4 x 3 cm.

Also received in the same container are three white-tan irregular shaped pieces of tissue that aggregate to 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm.  The three small fragments of tissue are entirely submitted in cassette. B1.  The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes B2-B5.   Velasquez for Neuropath/vb MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the prior right temporal brain biopsy and have confirmed the previously rendered diagnosis of glioblastoma (SHS-08-23516).  We have reviewed the frozen section and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment. Permanent sections from both specimens show similar findings and will be described together.  These sections demonstrate a cellular proliferation of astrocytic cells with pleomorphic, angular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm set in a fibrillar background.  Frequent mitotic figures are seen.  Vascular proliferation, intravascular fibrin thrombosis, and pseudopalisading necrosis are identified. The sections additionally demonstrate changes consistent with previous radiation treatment.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:   The first specimen is received fresh from the OR, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and designation ""left breast.""  The specimen consists of one fibroadipose fragment, measuring 14.5 x 15.0 x 3.5 cm, with an attached skin ellipse, measuring 3.2 x 2.2 cm.  The specimen contains no sutures and has not been oriented by the surgeon.  There is no axilla present for orientation of the specimen.  The specimen is inked such that deep is black and superficial is blue, and fixed in formalin overnight.  The specimen is then serially sectioned at 3.0 mm intervals and radiographed to reveal several potential areas of microcalcifications.  These areas of microcalcifications are dispersed throughout the specimen.  There are no areas suspicious for carcinoma by radiography.  Grossly, the cut surfaces reveal no area suspicious for carcinoma.  Numerous large cysts are observed throughout the fibrous areas of the specimen.  Representative sections of the specimen are taken and submitted in cassettes B1-B15, with possible microcalcifications represented in cassettes B9, B12, and B14.  The nipple is submitted separately in a cassette labeled LT. The next specimen is received fresh from the OR designated ""right breast"" and consists of one fibrofatty fragment which measures 20.0 x 14.5 x 3.7 cm, with an attached skin ellipse, measuring 10.7 x 3.5 cm.  The specimen contains no sutures, but does contain an axillary tail which is used for orientation.  The specimen is inked such that green is inferior anterior, blue is superior anterior, and black is deep.  The specimen is then fixed in formalin overnight, serially sectioned at 3.0 mm intervals, and radiographed.  The radiograph reveals multiple areas of microcalcifications.  In addition, there is an area of radiolucency which grossly appears to correspond to a biopsy cavity site which is filled with numerous fibrous strands. There is a firm fibrous area which may represent a nodule located in the central anterior portion of the specimen.  Representative sections of the specimen are taken from medial to lateral in cassettes A1-A16.  Possible areas of microcalcifications are submitted in cassettes A1-A6, A7, A9, and A11.  Representative sections surrounding the biopsy site are submitted in cassettes A9-A16.  The potential nodular tumor is submitted in cassettes A6 and A7.  The nipple is submitted separately in cassette RT. Park/crh The axillary tail from the right breast specimen is truncated and inspected for lymph nodes.  Eight potential lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes A17 (5) and A18 (3).  Park/crh COMMENT:   The slides from the prior right breast excisional biopsy were not available for review.  By report, the prior biopsy shows a grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 2.5 cm, as well as intermediate and low grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid and cribriform types (PAS-02-04813). Sections of the right breast specimen show extensive biopsy site changes as well as non-proliferative fibrocystic changes including two radial scars (slide A7, A10), an intraductal papilloma (slide A8) and benign cysts and apocrine metaplasia.  A focus of ductal hyperplasia is also seen (slide A11). Microcalcifications are seen in association with benign ducts (slide A4, A5, A14).  There is no evidence of residual in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma.  The lymph nodes isolated from the axillary portion of the specimen show evidence of metastatic carcinoma in 4 of 4 lymph nodes (4/4). Based on the information from the prior right breast excisional biopsy report (PAS-02-18184), the TNM staging for this patient is TNM: T2 N1 MX. Sections of the left breast specimen show non-proliferative (cysts, apocrine metaplasia) as well as proliferative fibrocystic changes (adenosis, fibroadenomatous changes, ductal hyperplasia).  There is no evidence of carcinoma.

We completely agree with the prior diagnosis of glioblastoma. This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. MICROSCOPIC: Permanent histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. Per report, the proliferation index as measured by Ki67 staining is 42.1%. Other immunohistochemical stains that were reported include: GFAP (diffusely strongly positive), EGFR (diffusely positive), IDH R132H mutation (negative), p53 (variable, with up to 50% positive in some areas), PTEN (negative in tumor), Olig-2 (variable, positive in up to 50% of areas), PDGFR-alpha (scattered positive cells).

We agree with the submitted diagnosis.  The patient's 1/4/2016 biopsy was not reviewed here but is described as showing diffuse astrocytoma, IDH-wildtype, WHO grade II.  We reviewed slides from his subsequent 10/11/2016 biopsy here and confirm the diagnosis of glioblastoma (SHS-16-46825).  With the nuclear atypia identified in this resection, we suspect there are occasional neoplastic cells but not definite as to indicate recurrent neoplasm. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections reveal fragments of predominantly white matter with extensive necrosis, gliosis, vascular remodeling, and hemosiderin deposition.  There are hypercellular areas with macrophages, plump astrocytes and some lymphocytes.  There are some atypical glial nuclei within this population.  A Ki-67 performed on block B1 does not reveal increased nuclear labeling. CLINICAL HISTORY: Extracting from the electronic medical record and provided materials, this patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with a generalized seizure in December 2015. He was found to have a left frontal mass. He underwent biopsy on January 14, 2016 showing anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wildtype WHO grade II, BRAF negative, ATRX negative, p53 20-30% positive.  He received radiotherapy which he completed April 15, 2016 and completed 4 cycles of TMZ.  MRI from September showed an increase in enhancement of the left frontal mass.  He subsequently underwent a brain biopsy at Stanford on 10/11/2016 showing glioblastoma (see SHS-16-46825).  He received radiation with temozolomide and a subsequent MRI showed enhancement within the left anterior limb of the internal capsule extending into the subinsular region.  He had a subtotal resection at UCSF on 11/7/16 and he is here for further management.

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. All controls show appropriate reactivity. AMENDMENT REPORT This report is amended to correct the intraoperative consultation technique that was incorrectly transcribed as a frozen section (FSA) with the correction to a cytologic preparation (SMA). Revised text is highlighted in italics.  This is the only revision. DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL MASS, BIOPSY --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV LUMMUS/BORN COMMENT:  We reviewed the intraoperative cytologic preparations, and agree with the diagnosis.  We have not reviewed slides from the prior left frontal biopsy.  MGMT promotor methylation studies are underway and the results will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the fixed tissue demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm composed of cells with considerable cytologic variation, coarse chromatin, irregular nuclear borders and occasional mitotic figures.  There is microvascular proliferation but no definite necrosis.  A BRAF (V600E) immunostain is negative. CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed gentleman who initially presented with a generalized seizure in December 2015. He was found to have a left frontal mass. He underwent biopsy on January 14, 2016 by Dr. Helbig at Doctor's Medical Center of Modesto. Pathology was consistent with astrocytoma, IDH wildtype WHO II, BRAF negative, ATRX negative, p53 20-30% positive.  He received radiotherapy which he completed April 15, 2016 and completed 4 cycles of TMZ.  MRI from September showed an increase in enhancement of the left frontal mass. OPERATION: Image guided brain biopsy INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: SMA: BRAIN, LEFT, BIOPSY      --   HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA, FAVOR GLIOBLASTOMA      (Lummus/Born) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""left brain tumor"" is received fresh and consists of three roughly cylindrical white-tan hemorrhagic fragments of tissue measuring 1.8 cm in aggregate length and 0.2 cm in diameter each.  A scrape prep is performed.  The remaining tissue is entirely submitted between filter paper in one cassette labeled A1.

SMALL BOWEL AND COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM AND CECUM, RESECTION --   TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA, 3.0 CM, EXCISED (SEE COMMENT) --   FIVE LYMPH NODES WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY TAN/LOUIE/MARTIN/LONGACRE/HIGGINS COMMENT:  The cecum specimen contains a 3 cm polyp, which is entirely submitted for microscopic examination. Histologic sections show a tubulovillous adenoma. Although some foci show increased architectural complexity with cribriform structures, high grade cytologic dysplasia is absent. Focally, the adenomatous proliferation is disrupted, and scattered clusters of epithelial cells and extravasated mucin pools are present. Although the cells are surrounded by reactive-appearing stromal fibrosis, we favor these features represent biopsy site change, rather than a true desmoplastic stromal response to invasion. This consideration is supported by the lack of high-grade cytologic atypia in the disrupted epithelial clusters, which appear similar to the overlying low-grade adenomatous proliferation. Also, additional foci of so-called ""misplaced epithelium"" are seen, in which portions of the adenoma appear to be present deep to the muscularis mucosae but maintain surrounding lamina propria. These features have all been described in previously biopsied adenomas and are a diagnostic mimic of invasion. Dr. Longacre has reviewed pertinent selected slides and agrees that the findings are most consistent with biopsy site changes and do not support the presence of invasive carcinoma. CLINICAL HISTORY: 75-year-old female with a colonic mass OPERATION: Laparoscopic assisted right colon resection OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  minimal adhesions, lap R hemicolectomy performed and stapled side to side anastomosis performed. Tattoo marking cecum and specimen opened on back table verifying that mass was removed. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""cecum"" is received in formalin and consists of a piece of bowel and attached mesentery measuring overall 11 x 8.5 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is already incised by the surgeon through the middle of a mucosal polypoid mass on the antimesenteric side, which measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm  The specimen is not oriented.  However, there are two stapled margins on either end of the colonic segment. One of them measures 3.8 cm and is 2 cm from the polypoid mass. The other measures 4 cm and is 6.5 cm from the mass. The bowel measures 13 cm in length and is further opened along its length to reveal that the mass is just distal of the ileocecal valve (0.6 cm). Serial sectioning of the lesion reveals a polypoid lesion that does not clearly invade the bowel wall. The mesentery attached to the bowel is focally hemorrhagic, with a 50 cc clot, and has mild adhesions to the bowel wall. It is palpated for lymph nodes and five candidate lymph nodes are identified. The rest of the mesenteric fat is immersed in Carnoy's solution. The appendix is not identified.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old female with left breast mass, suspicious for carcinoma. OPERATION:  Left breast biopsy. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out carcinoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Specimens are received in three separate containers labeled with the patient's name ""Taft"" and medical record number. The first specimen is received in formalin and stated to be ""left breast mass"" and consists of a fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm.  The specimen was oriented by clips such as one clip equal medial, two clips equal anterior, three clips equal superior.  A suture marks a nodule.  The specimen was inked the usual way such that deep equal black, anterior superior equal blue and anterior inferior equal green.  The suture marked nodule was inked red.  The specimen was serially sectioned at 0.3 cm intervals from lateral to medial dimension.  The specimen was radiographed to reveal suspicious poorly circumscribed opacity measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.  Possible microcalcifications are present too. The specimen was submitted entirely in cassettes A1 to A8.  The possible microcalcifications submitted in cassettes A6 and A7.  The tumor was submitted in cassettes A5 and A4. The second specimen is received in formalin and stated to be ""supernumerary nipple"" and consists of a nipple measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  The surgical margin of the nipple was inked black.  The specimen was serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette B1. The third specimen is received in formalin and stated to be ""circumferential true margin around mass"" and consists of 14 fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate.  The surgical margin of the unoriented fragments were inked black.  The specimen was radiographed to reveal one possible microcalcification.  The specimen was serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes C1 to C7.  The microcalcification was submitted in C2.  Dobo for Tan/jt COMMENT:  Sections of the left breast show invasive lobular carcinoma.  The carcinoma meets modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson criteria for a grade I lesion (3 points for poor tubules, 1 point for nuclei, 1 point for low mitotic activity).  The tumor measures 0.9 cm in largest dimension (A4, A5).  The tumor is seen less than 0.2 mm to the specimen surface near the suture that marks the lesion (inked red A5).  An in-situ component is not identified.  No definite angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  An immunohistochemical stain for E-Cadherin is negative, providing support for lobular carcinoma.  The tumor stains positive for ER (2-3+, 60%) and PR (3+, 80%).  The tumor stains negatively for Her2neu (0, negative) and has a proliferation rate of less than 5% by Ki67 staining.

ADDENDUM CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 62 year-old woman with breast carcinoma. This addendum report is issued only to comment on immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki-67 and HER2NEU.  The prior diagnoses remain unchanged. ADDENDUM COMMENT: Immunostaining demonstrates the invasive tumor to be estrogen and progesterone receptor positive with no HER2NEU overexpression and a <5 % proliferation rate. We find very good correlation between these stains and the presence ER and PR as determined by enzyme immunoassay.  Again, only the invasive component is evaluated. Proliferative rate as determined by immunohistochemical staining has been shown to correlate with disease free survival (Am J Clin Pathol, 1995, 104:42-9), however, correlation with mitotic figure counts is suggested.  The FDA approved HercepTest (TM) is scored from 0-3+.  Staining in less than 10% of tumor cells is scored as showing no overexpression (0 or 1+).  Staining in more than 10% of tumor cells is considered overexpression and designated as either weak positive (2+) or strong positive (3+) depending upon the intensity.

Based on review of the limited material in this biopsy, the morphology and immunophenotype are suggestive of a glioblastoma with no expression of mutant IDH1 R132H by immunohistochemistry; however, the features do not meet strict morphologic criteria for glioblastoma. Next-generation sequencing to identify molecular features of glioblastoma will be performed (UCSF500), and results will be issued in an addendum. Dr. Born reviewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis rendered. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slide and confirm the diagnosis rendered intraoperatively. Histologic sections show a hypercellular proliferation of atypical glial cells with irregular nuclear contours infiltrating the background brain parenchyma. Numerous scattered mitotic figures are present. Microscopic foci of necrosis are not clearly present. No definite microvascular proliferation is identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed and evaluated on block B1, which show no expression of IDH1 R132H (wild type).

Van Hoy (7/1/2021) ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to describe the results of next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the UCSF 500 panel. MOLECULAR TESTING:  Samples from the neoplasm as unstained sections from block B1 were submitted to the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory. The findings are as follows: B. BRAIN, RIGHT PARIETAL LESION, RESECTION --   CDKN2A/CDKN2B HOMOZYGOUS/BIALLELIC DELETION --   POSITIVE FOR PTEN P.W274* MUTATION (VAF= 75%) --   POSITIVE FOR TERT C.-124C>T PROMOTER MUTATION (VAF= 40%) --   TRISOMY CHROMOSOME 7, MONOSOMY CHROMOSOME 10 --   0 OF 85 MICROSATELLITES UNSTABLE (0.00%) --   TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN: 4.1 MUTATIONS/MB ADDENDUM COMMENT: All variants considered ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"" are reported here. The molecular profiling results demonstrate the presence of a population of neoplastic cells with cytogenetic alterations in CDKN2A/CDKN2B, PTEN, and the TERT promoter as well as the chromosomal alterations trisomy 7, monosomy 10, which are some of the most common seen in IDH-wild-type glioblastomas arising in the cerebral hemispheres [1]. Overall, the morphologic and molecular features are consistent with glioblastoma, IDH-wild-type, WHO grade 4 [2-3].  For additional details on the variants detected as well as the full list of variants (including variants of uncertain significance) and methodologic details, please see the complete UCSF 500 report. The diagnosis will be revised in an amendment. References: 1.  Brennan CW, Verhaak RG, et al; TCGA Research Network. The somatic genomic landscape of glioblastoma.

The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings demonstrate an infiltrating glial neoplasm with microvascular proliferation and necrosis, warranting a diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  The diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Peter Ames on 3/25 and 3/31/2015. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the frontal lobe tumor demonstrate varied histology. Some areas are comprised of nests of epithelioid cells with round to ovoid nuclei, finely stippled chromatin, variably prominent nuclei and clear to focally rhabdoid cytoplasm. Other areas are comprised of monomorphic cells with small, round to ovoid nuclei, arranged in a microcystic pattern. There are rare foci of calcifications, associated with interspersed ganglionic cells. There is microvascular proliferation and extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemistry prepared at the submitting institution demonstrates neoplastic cells have variable or scant immunoreactivity for vimentin and EMA (some appears dot and ring) while mixed cytokeratin, Cam 5.2, CD10 and Pax8 are negative. The PAS stain is weak and PAS-d is negative for cytoplasmic staining. Immunohistochemistry performed at Stanford demonstrate that the neoplastic cells are variably positive for GFAP, synaptophysin and EMA (thread like) but are negative for IDH R132H mutation and intact nuclear ATRX.  Scattered non-neoplastic cells (ganglionic cell nuclear morphology) are positive for NeuN.  There is no pericellular reticulin. CLINICAL HISTORY:  From submitted patient information including the cover letter we find Scott Christopher Cameron is a 48 year old male with a 5.6 x 7.2 cm midline brain tumor.  Review of the submitted imaging (MRI) reveals a large bifrontal mass that is centered in the corpus callosum, has heterogeneous signal, is heterogeneously enhancing and has areas poorly demarcated from brain.

With regard to the original resection (UVS-10-1283), we entirely agree with the originating Pathologist's interpretation of a glioblastoma. However, we see no evidence of glioblastoma in the subsequent right frontal lobe biopsies (UVS-13-2254). Our neuroradiologist consultant, Dr. Nancy Fischbein, has reviewed the neuroimaging for the current case (UVS-13-2254) and advises that the findings could reflect radiation changes. Dr. Brown discussed the findings with Dr. Urie by telephone on March 1, 2013 at 3:20pm. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the current case (UVS-10-1283) show prominent numbers of reactive astrocytes. Microcystic degenerative changes and microcalcifications are seen focally. Several vessels show sclerotic changes, with homogenous thickening of vessel walls. Areas of geographic necrosis are not identified. Immunohistochemistry for IDH-1 is negative. Ki67 demonstrates a low proliferative rate (<2%). These findings are consistent with radiation changes. Histologic sections of the prior case (UVS-10-1283) demonstrate a markedly cellular neoplasm with a fibrillary background. Focal dystrophic calcification is observed. Tumor cells are marked by a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear hyperchromasia, and irregular nuclear contours. Vascular proliferative change and necrosis are noted. These findings are consistent with a glioblastoma. CLINICAL HISTORY:  34-year-old man with a history of glioblastoma of the right frontal brain status post resection and adjuvant therapy with Temodar and radiation (completed 3/29/2010). Brain MRI (1/10/13) demonstrated an enhancing area of the resection cavity from which the consultation slides are derived.

We agree with your impression of a malignant neoplasm. The sampled tissue shows areas of primitive-appearing small cells that support the diagnosis above.  These glioblastomas are reported to portend an increased risk of remote subarachnoid spread and CSF seeding.  If requested, MGMT promoter methylation analysis can be initiated.  Clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Berulava on 8/2/2019. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections demonstrate a proliferation of neoplastic small round blue cells with sheets of cells showing marked cytologic atypia, brisk mitotic activity and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, imparting a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) appearance. Other focal areas demonstrate atypical glial cells with angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, microvascular proliferation and areas of necrosis are identified.  Fragments of infiltrated cerebral tissue are also noted. The provided immunohistochemical stains (HMB45, MelA, S100, Vimentin and GFAP) as well as immunohistochemical stains performed at Stanford (IDH1 R132H, p53, ATRX and c-Myc) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells show positive staining with GFAP, S100 and vimentin. ATRX is retained (wildtype), p53 shows some positive nuclei (most consistent with non-mutated). C-Myc is expressed in 50-60% of the neoplastic nuclei (positive). IDH1 R132H, HMB45 and MelA are negative in the neoplastic cells.

We agree with your initial diagnostic impression of a glial neoplasm with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features.  However, we feel the overall features are those of a glioblastoma, and EGFR overexpression is strong support for a small cell variant.  EGFR overexpression can be seen in the setting of gene amplification, but may also occur in patients with a constitutively activating EGFR (V3) gene mutation. We would be happy to facilitate additional studies in this matter, if the distinction becomes of clinical significance.  Dr. Martin discussed the findings of this case with Dr. Garcia-Kennedy at 15:45 on 5/25/2012 and with Dr. Moretto at 11:30 on 5/30/2012.

We concur with the diagnosis of glioblastoma.  In addition we find no immunohistochemical evidence for an IDH1 R132H mutation, although other mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes are possible. Based on methylation-specific PCR, the MGMT promoter is not methylated. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. James Zehnder, Stanford Clinical Laboratories, interpreted the MGMT promoter methylation studies. MICROSCOPIC:  The received ten H&E-stained histologic sections show an infiltrative glial neoplasm characterized by cells that generally do not have discernable cytoplasmic borders, pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin and irregular nuclear contours. In some areas the neoplastic cells show high cellularity, scant cytoplasm, smaller, less pleomorphic, nuclei (features of small cell glioblastoma).  In other areas cells show moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background and occasional perivascular accumulations. Mitotic figures are numerous. Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present. Immunohistochemistry prepared on a section from block 7 for the IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. MOLECULAR STUDIES:  MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene.  Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. NOTE: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling.  Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

Neuroimaging revealed a left parietal lobe lesion. The lesion ws biopsied on 5/11/01 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (Anaheim, CA) and was interpreted as anaplastic astrocytoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (Anaheim, CA) are two H&E stained slides (MS-01-0004021 A-1, A-2), six immunostained slides (MS-01-0004021 A-1, A-2), five immunohistochemistry  positive and negative control slides, and the corresponding pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The H&E stained slides show fragments of brain tissue admixed with blood and fragments of a glial neoplasm. The tumor cells display pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm. The cells are polygonal to spindle shaped and in some areas are clustered around moderate sized blood vessels. Rare mitotic figures are identified. Small foci of tumor necrosis are noted. Focal endothelial hypertrophy is present. The tumor fragments are relatively small and are separate from the brain fragments rendering the anatomic relationship of the tumor to the brain parenchyma unclear. Immunohistochemistry: The submitted immunostained slides were reviewed. Several of the tumor cells are strongly GFAP positive. The nuclei of occasional tumor cells are reactive for p53. Ki-67 highlights up to approximately 40 to 50% of the tumor cell nuclei focally. COMMENT: Although the biopsy material submitted contains a limited amount of tumor, the histologic features present are most consistent with glioblastoma multiforme.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (Anaheim, CA) are seven additional slides (C10683-01) and the corresponding pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The H&E slides show fragments of gray and white matter demonstrating a moderately pleomorphic glial neoplasm. The tumor cells show moderately enlarged spindle shaped, atypical astrocyte nuclei. Occasional larger oval atypical nuclei are also identified. The tumor cell cytoplasm is not discernible. The tumor is infiltrating the cortex and demonstrates malignant satellitosis. Mitotic figures are not seen. A single focus of endothelial hypertrophy is noted. Necrosis is not present. COMMENT: The additional slides are from the biopsy performed on 5/11/01 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center (Anaheim, CA). The first specimen submitted for our review (MS-01-0004021) is from a subsequent resection performed at Loma Linda University Medical Center (Loma Linda, CA) on 5/20/01 which was interpreted as ""high grade astrocytoma"" at Loma Linda. We agree with the Kaiser neuropathologist that the biopsy specimen (C10683-01) alone is best interpreted as anaplastic astrocytoma due to the nuclear pleomorphism and spindle cell morphology. Given that the tumor resection specimen (MS-01-0004021) demonstrates glioblastoma multiforme, the biopsy must have not been from the epicenter of the tumor, but rather from its infiltrating border. The final neuropathologic diagnosis remains glioblastoma multiforme.

Breitweser for Neuropath/vb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  We have reviewed the frozen section and squash preparation slides and concur with the rendered intraoperative diagnosis.  The histologic sections show a neoplasm composed predominantly of pleomorphic neoplastic gemistocytic astrocytes with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei.  There are also multiple aggregates of bizarre multinucleated tumor cells.  Frequent granular mitotic figures are observed.  There are scattered foci of pseudopalisading necrosis.  Frank glomeruloid vascular proliferation is absent; however, focal microvascular proliferation is identified. Also seen is a minor population of primitive appearing cells characterized by hyperchromatic nuclei and minimal cytoplasm with focal nuclear molding.  There is no increased mitotic (compared to the remainder of the neoplasm) in the minor population. COMMENT:  Some areas of this neoplasm are compatible with the histologic variant of giant cell glioblastoma.  Another population of cells raises consideration for glioblastoma with primitive neuroectodermal-like differentiation; however, this population is noted to encompass a very minor component of the neoplasm.

We have reviewed the prior case (SHS-16-2297/16SK-299) and are in agreement with your diagnosis. The histologic features and immunophenotype of this tumor are consistent with the diagnosis of a recurrent/residual glioblastoma, IDH1 R132H-wildtype, WHO Grade IV. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the preliminary diagnosis to Dr. Stanley Hino on 4/29/2019. MICROSCOPIC:  Specimen A, B, C, d and E have a similar morphology and are described together. The provided histologic section of the current brain lesion demonstrates hypercellular cerebral tissue with infiltrating atypical glial cells characterized by irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei with minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background. Rare mitoses are identified. Scattered vessels show changes reminiscent of microvascular proliferation. Thrombosed vessels are noted. Additionally specimen E (block A3/5) demonstrates focally definite pseudo-palisading necrosis. Immunohistochemistry performed at Stanford on block (A3/5) demonstrate that the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 70 year old female who presented in 2016 with a right temporal-parietal mass diagnosed as a glioblastoma. After resection and radio-chemotherapy the patient went in remission. She now presents with a enhancing lesion in the temporal-parietal lobe thought to represent disease progression.

The overall findings are those of a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  This lesion is comprised mostly by small cell glioblastoma histomorphology with brisk mitotic activity.  Robust membranous EGFR immunohistochemical staining supports this diagnosis.  An oligodendroglial component is not seen. MICROSCOPIC:  Permanent histologic sections from consult blocks A1 and B1 show an infiltrative malignant glial neoplasm characterized by round cells with scant astrocytic processes, geographic necrosis, microvascular proliferation and frequent mitotic figures.  An area with increased astrocytic processes and many multinucleated tumor giant cells comprises less than 5% of the tumor.  Many giant cells demonstrate an infiltrative single cell pattern.  Review of the outside immunohistochemical stains performed demonstrates GFAP staining positivity while CAM5.2, Ber-EP4, and ER stains are negative.  An EGFR immunostain additionally performed at Stanford University Medical Center is strongly positive in a membranous pattern in the small cells and in several giant cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Received for review from California Pacific Medical Center (San Francisco, CA), from Dr. Ian Jaffee, are two touch prep slides, two H&E stained slides, and four immunohistochemical stains from a left frontal lobe craniotomy (CPP-11-35764; 11/29/2011).

HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 4/3/2014 1:31 PM **ADDENDUM** ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to report the results of MGMT promoter methylation studies. ADDENDUM DESCRIPTION: MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR.  This specimen is negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene.  Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.  The diagnosis remains unchanged. DISCLAIMER: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Dr. Jonathan Lavezo notified Dr. Christopher Soon of the diagnosis on 3/28/2018. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The smear preparations show a cellular neoplastic process that shows scattered mitotic figures. Histologic sections show small fragments of glial tissue with an infiltrative glial neoplasm. The previously frozen tissue shows a cellular, slightly spindled neoplasm with a myxoid background, necrosis, and occasional vascular thromboses. The additionally submitted tissue shows two small foci of increased cellularity with atypical cells and microvascular proliferation with vascular thromboses. Immunohistochemical stains performed at Stanford for IDH1 R132H, ATRX, and P53 are reviewed. The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H and show retained ATRX (not mutated) and wild-type p53 staining. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 76 year old male with a history of prostate cancer. MRI of brain shows an infiltrative and expansile lesion centered with in the deep gray matter structures of the right cerebral hemisphere with contrast enhancement. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Pathology materials labeled as case number CPP-18-6775 (3 H&E slides, 1 diff-quick smear, and 1 block labeled B1) are received from California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA on behalf of Dr. Christopher Soon. The immunologic tests described above as prepared at Stanford University were developed and their performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Immunoperoxidase Laboratory. Unless indicated otherwise, they have not been cleared or approved by the US FDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.  All controls show appropriate reactivity. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE.; 2. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE.; 3. PROSTATE (TAKEN BY UROLOGY) CLINICAL HISTORY: Prostate cancer. OPERATION: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The first specimen is received in formalin as ""left pelvic lymph node"" and consists of multiple yellow-tan fragments of fibrofatty the measuring 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm.  Four lymph nodes are grossly identified and range in greatest dimension from 3.5 to 0.5 cm.  All lymph node tissue is entirely submitted as follows: two lymph nodes (one inked and the other serially sectioned) - A1; one serially sectioned lymph node - A2; and one serially sectioned lymph node - A3-A4. Specimen #2 is received in formalin as ""right pelvic lymph node"" and consists of multiple yellow-tan fragments of fibrofatty tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm.  One lymph node is grossly identified and measures 3.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The lymph node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes B1-B2. The third specimen ""prostate"" weighs 51 g and measures 5.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm.  The left seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm; the right seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm.  The prostate is inked black on the right and blue on the left posterior rectal and posterolateral surfaces (margin) and blue on the anterior and anterolateral surface (margin).  Red ink is on borders of incision(s) into prostate, which represent small tissue samples removed for culture.  The prostate is sectioned and submitted in toto as follows:  II - Bladder neck margin perpendicular to the proximal urethra:  ZR and ZL - Margin of the apex is first separated from prostate by transverse cut, then subsectioned at 3.0 mm intervals sagittally  and parasagittally; IIIR and IIIL - Transverse section between prostate and seminal vesicle; LY-LQ and RY-RQ - The remainder of the prostate is cut in transverse sections from the apex to the base and cut perpendicular to the rectal surface; LSV and RSV - Left and right seminal vesicles, respectively.

Sections of the prostate show extensive adenocarcinoma involving both the right and left lobes.  The carcinoma is composed largely of Gleason Pattern 3, although there are some areas of Gleason Pattern 4 and focal areas of Gleason Pattern 5 with single cells infiltrating stroma (section RV).  The tumor shows focal involvement of both the right and left apices, but it is not at the surgical margin in these or other sections.  The bladder neck margin, seminal vesicles and transverse sections between prostate and seminal vesicles (slides II, LSV, RSV, IIIR, and IIIL) are free of carcinoma.  There is focal perineural invasion (section LQ).  No pseudocapsular or angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The non-neoplastic prostate shows extensive acute and chronic prostatitis.  The left and right pelvic lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (5/5). I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

We agree with your diagnostic impression and note there is a malignant glial neoplasm.  Although the neoplasm shows ependymal differentiation with perivascular pseudorosettes, the infiltration, areas lacking ependymoma features, and diffuse, uniform GFAP immunoreactivity led us to consider this to be a glioblastoma.  Additional testing for MGMT promoter methylation is initiated and will be reported in an addendum. Clinical and radiological correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Sean Pittman on 2/22/2019. MICROSCOPIC:  Specimens A and B have a similar appearance and are described together. The provided H&E sections reveal two fragments of an extensively infiltrating neoplasm consisting of atypical cells with a glial appearance focally arranged in perivascular pseudorosettes. The cells show angulated, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei with easily detectable mitoses.  Foci of microvascular proliferation are noted.  Pseudo-palisading necrosis is seen.  Rare neurons are noted to support an infiltrative neoplasm. The provided immunohistochemistry (GFAP, pan keratins, S100, Ki-67, EMA, CK Oscar, synaptophysin and chromogranin) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells show a strong positivity for GFAP with no acellular perivascular zones identified. S100 and pan keratins are also positive in the neoplastic cells. EMA shows focal perinuclear dots. Chromogranin, synaptophysin and CK Oscar are negative. The KI-62 is estimated to be positive in up to 20% of the neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemistry performed at Stanford on sections from the provided block show the neoplastic cells are negative for H3 K27M (not mutated).

The patchy GFAP positivity and molecular phenotype could lend favor to epithelioid- or gliosarcomatous-variants which are commonly associated with a more aggressive course and extracranial metastasis (Ref). Dr. D. Born (Neuropathology) has reviewed this case and concurs. References: 1. Lun M, Lok E, Gautam S, Wu E, Wong ET. The natural history of extracranial metastasis from glioblastoma multiforme.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The cytologic preparations show a population of pleomorphic round cells, seen as dense aggregates, loosely cohesive clusters, and single cells, characterized by small to enlarged nuclei with nuclear membrane irregularities, occasionally visible nucleoli, and variable amounts of delicate cytoplasm. Numerous degenerative cells are present in the background. The core biopsy sections show nests and sheets of malignant round cells with pleomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm infiltrating fibromuscular tissue. By immunohistochemistry, the malignant cells are diffusely positive for GFAP, OLIG2, and CD99; patchy positive for desmin, MDM2, and mixed cytokeratins (AE1/3, CAM 5.2); and negative for PAX8, SOX10, INSM1, PAX7, and SALL4. Congo red and trichrome stains are negative for amyloid deposition. ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A1, which contains approximately 20% tumor.

The original diagnosis of ""IDH1 R132H wildtype"" is revised to ""IDH-wildtype.  Revisions to the diagnosis and an amendment comment are highlighted in italics. DIAGNOSIS: A.   BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL, RESECTION (29-SP-20-2354; 08/27/2020) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 (SEE COMMENT) TOLAND/NIRSCHL/AHMADIAN/BORN AMENDMENT COMMENT:  Analysis for possible mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 was completed using SNaPshot methodology where there was no evidence for IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (molecular pathology accession 680909049).  As noted previously, the histologic findings, including microvascular proliferation and necrosis, are that of glioblastoma. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting and challenging case in consultation. We agree with your diagnostic impression of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. Given the patient age and ATRX mutant status by immunohistochemistry, this is suspicious for a secondary glioblastoma. Although the IDH1 R132H mutation that is present in ~90% of secondary glioblastomas was not identified, non-R132H mutations and mutations in IDH2 are identified in a subset of cases. Molecular testing for additional mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes is ordered and results will be conveyed in an amended report. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. The results were conveyed to Dr. Mohan by Dr. Angus Toland at 17:46 on 09/02/2020. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show an infiltrating hypercellular proliferation of atypical glial cells that in most areas produce dense cellularity.  The cells have relatively small, uniformly hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, and scant amounts of cytoplasm that produce indistinct cytoplasmic borders.  In many areas the infiltrated background is difficult to appreciate.  In addition, the neoplastic cells prominently infiltrate perivascular spaces and extend into the leptomeninges that are extensively invaded.  Atypical mitotic figures are present throughout. Occasional foci of microvascular proliferation are present with some regions of necrosis. Immunohistochemistry prepared at Stanford on sections from a provided block is negative for IDH1 R132H (not mutated, are generally negative for ATRX (mutant pattern), and uniformly positive for p53 (mutant pattern).

The majority of tissue available for review from the present resection shows necrosis, vascular changes and extensive gliosis as likely treatment effects.  Foci of residual neoplasm are confirmed by demonstration of an elevated Ki-67 labeling. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The submitted slides stained with H&E show large areas of coagulative necrosis, necrosis mixed with islands of low cellularity containing viable glial nuclei, increased blood vessels, many hyalinized and some fragments of brain with increased glial nuclei.  Amongst the viable glial nuclei there are some that are atypical.  Submitted immunohistochemistry shows scattered individual and focally clustered infiltrating cells, that have positive nuclei (as well as positive inflammatory and endothelial cell nuclei).  IDH1-R132H is positive in reactive and normal glia (not interpretable for possible neoplastic cell immunoreactivity). CLINICAL HISTORY:  38-year-old male with a left frontotemporal glioblastoma s/p biopsy 04/02/15 (IDH1 mutant, MGMT methylated), s/p concurrent radiation/chemotherapy with temozolomide, s/p Plerixafor clinical trial, and adjuvant monthly temozolomide. His neurologic exam remains normal. In review of the patient's most recent brain MRI, there is interval increase in size of contrast enhancement as well as FLAIR signal that is concerning for tumor progression. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  15 slides (S16-19619, 7/26/2016) are received from the University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE LESION, STEREOTACTIC BIOPSY --   ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA, WHO GRADE 3 METCALF/PLOWEY COMMENT:  Increased mitotic activity in this tumor biopsy substantiates the diagnosis of a WHO Grade 3 anaplastic astrocytoma. The tumor sample is predominantly infiltrating into gray matter and the possibility of unsampled higher grade tumor should be considered along with radiographic and clinical data.  The tumor is negative for the R132H IDH-1 mutation by immunohistochemistry.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are in progress and the results will be reported in EPIC. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and confirm the diagnosis rendered. Histologic sections show a diffuse astrocytoma infiltrating into gray matter with prominent secondary structuring.   Several mitotic figures are identified in a relatively small biopsy.  Definitive endothelial hyperplasia and necrosis are not identified.  An R132H IDH-1 immunostain (clone H09) is negative in the tumor (positive control is appropriate).

We have reviewed the prior pathology from the original resection (SHS-07-3755; 1/29/07) and recurrent tumor (SHS-07-18627; 5/14/07). The sections of the first specimen reveal predominantly cortex with perineuronal satellitosis and mild, focal perivascular chronic inflammation.  The minimal white matter demonstrates few macrophages, mild gliosis and oligodendroglial condensation.  No definite tumor cells are seen. The sections of the second specimen show extensive areas of necrosis infiltrated by macrophages.  The viable brain parenchyma reveals gliosis and focal perivascular chronic inflammation.  Rare atypical cells with a gemistocytic phenotype have enlarged angulated nuclei. Scattered areas of perivascular lymphocytic inflammation are present.  No mitotic activity is seen. The sections of the third specimen reveal larger fragments of tissue with geographic necrosis and a few viable cells around blood vessels.  In one viable area of the specimen (slide C2), atypical cells characterized by nuclear enlargement and pleomorphism are identified.  No mitotic activity is seen. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the prior pathology and note the diagnoses of glioblastoma (SHS-07-3755; 1/29/07) and recurrent glioblastoma (SHS-07-18627; 5/14/07).  The presence of abundant necrosis with few atypical cells in this case makes confident differentiation between radiation/reactive change and scant residual tumor cells challenging.  Rare residual neoplastic cells in the submitted tissue cannot be excluded.

BRAIN, RIGHT PARIETAL TUMOR, BIOPSY --   GLIAL NEOPLASM (SEE COMMENT) LAVEZO/SAMGHABADI/BORN COMMENT:  The biopsy has a pleomorphic, moderately cellular glial neoplasm that is difficult to characterize and grade due to multiple factors including lack of prior pathology for comparison, likely radiation changes and sample size.  As we anticipate receiving and reviewing the slides from the 2012 outside pathology (O'Connor Hospital case SO12-663) and a resection specimen from scheduled surgery we are deferring further characterization of the present biopsy.  We have viewed the intraoperative frozen section and cytologic preparations and concur with the diagnosis. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of brain demonstrate moderately cellular tissue with areas of necrosis. There is an infiltrate of neoplastic cells that have heterogeneous nuclear features with no identifiable cytoplasm in a fibrillary and vacuolated background. We did not find mitotic figures in a search of 20 high power fields. The included blood vessels show thickened hyalinized walls without microvascular proliferation.

We are receiving this case at the request of Dr. Chang for review in association with a recent prior case for this patient here at Stanford (SHS-15-53360 showing glial neoplasm). While we agree with the previously rendered diagnosis of high-grade glioma, we find that the microvascular proliferation seen in H&E sections for specimen J is more consistent with the diagnosis of Glioblastoma. MGMT molecular testing has been ordered and will be reported in EPIC. We note that the immunophenotypic findings in light of the patient's age raise the possibility of another IDH1 or an IDH2 mutation in an otherwise secondary glioblastoma which would carry a more favorable prognosis, and which can be explored of clinically warranted. Dr. Donald Born has seen the slides and agrees with our diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: Extracting from the electronic medical record and information provided at intraoperative consultation we find Eduardo Rojas is a 37 year-old male with a history of a right sided brain tumor that was resected in 2012 at O'Connor Hospital (outside pathology report SO12-663) with subsequent radiation and chemotherapy who now presents with several weeks of intermittent worsening left-sided weakness and numbness, for which he had been seen here in the emergency room on several occasions.  MR imaging shows an irregularly enhancing, infiltrative lesion in the right parietal lobe with multifocal T2/FLAIR signal abnormality, extension into the right frontal lobe, right temporal lobe, right thalamus and right internal/external capsules and associated midline shift. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The histologic sections for specimens B Â¿ J show similar findings of brain white and gray matter with infiltrating malignant glia with prominent nuclear atypia and pleomorphism in association with microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining performed on the outside (GFAP) highlight a fibrillar background. The outside Ki-67 labels 1-10% of neoplastic cells. We requested the block on this case and have performed additional immunohistochemical stains. Neoplastic cells are not labeled by IDH1 (R132H) or ATRX. P53 however is positive in the tumor.

We have reviewed the frozen section and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment. Sections from both specimens demonstrate similar features and will be discussed together. These sections demonstrate white and gray matter involved by a hypercellular proliferation of pleomorphic astrocytes, and focal microvascular proliferation. Fragments of necrotic tissue resembling necrotic tumor are also seen.  These areas, best seen on sections from specimen B, are most suggestive of treatment effect.

There is focal necrosis and vascular changes in the present resection that may represent treatment effect or expected findings in glioblastoma.  Further clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We reviewed the frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis. Histologic sections from all parts show a glial neoplasm characterized by moderate hypercellularity, abundant nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic figures, and small foci of necrosis.  There is also focal microvascular proliferation, although this is quite limited. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per the Pathology Tissue Exam Request: ""71 yo Female with GBM."" In the electronic medical record, Epic, we find Ana Canizales had resection of a left occipital glioblastoma IDH, M1 R132H wild-type, GMT unmethylated, s/p resection 10/25/20.  She then had concurrent chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide x6 cycles.  She was on Optune when recently admitted with several weeks of worsening right sided weakness and alteration in mentation.  MRI showed interval enlargement of mass-like enhancement, with punctate restricted diffusion, along the anterolateral margin of the left occipital resection cavity with extension to the left lateral ventricle. There is overall hypoperfusion of the enhancing regions, with some areas of apparent hyperperfusion actually corresponding to susceptibility artifact and normal structures like choroid plexus.  While these findings are indeterminate, given the overall hypoperfusion, radiation-related effects are considered likely to be the dominant process.

Following the recent cIMPACT (consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Taxonomy) recommendations these findings warrant the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of a glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Recent literature demonstrates that these IDH1/2 wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas with EGFR amplification or TERT promoter have a clinical course similar to that of a grade IV glioblastomas. The molecular findings are reported in the addendums found below. Additionally a BRAF mutation, NF1 mutations, CDKN2A splice site mutation and a PTPN1 were noted. MGMT promoter methylation is positive and is reported in EPIC. Clinical correlation is required.

Acta Neuropathol. 2018 Nov;136(5):805-810 COMMENT:  The Stanford solid tumor actionable mutation panel (STAMP), along with MGMT studies, have been ordered and will be reported in an addendum. Dr. Born viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We reviewed the frozen sections and touch preparations and confirm the diagnosis rendered. The histologic findings in parts A, B, C, D, and E are similar and will be described together. Sections show a proliferation of glial cells with mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism and eosinophilic cytoplasm infiltrating brain parenchyma. No mitotic figure, microvascular proliferation, or necrosis are identified. An immunohistochemical stain performed on block B2 for the IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. CLINICAL HISTORY: Brain tumor OPERATION: Right craniotomy for tumor resection CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right temporal mass, seizures. ANCILLARY STUDIES: If ancillary studies are indicated they may be performed on block B2, which contains approximately 90% tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FSA: RIGHT TEMPORAL BRAIN TUMOR      --   GLIOMA      (AHMADIAN/VOGEL) GROSS DESCRIPTION: Five specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Histologic sections of the right frontal brain tumor demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by cells with angular, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, and increased mitotic activity. Many of the cells also contain round nuclei, suggesting the possibility of an oligodendroglial component. The background is notable for a prominent microvascular proliferation including vascular tufts.  Immunohistochemical stains performed demonstrate cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells for GFAP and p53, while lacking immunoreactivity for IDH1.

The original diagnosis remains unchanged. The text of the molecular report is reproduced in the addendum comment. ADDENDUM COMMENT: Results: Negative Comment: Negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene.Â  Interpretation: This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.Â  FISH DESCRIPTION: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was negative for simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

We agree with the submitting pathologist's diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV for the initial resection in 04/2013.  No residual is identified on the re-resection on 6/2013.   At the request of Dr. Gordon Li, we will request a block and perform MGMT promoter methylation testing.  These results will be reported separately from the laboratory and when available can be viewed in EPIC. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of the right temporal brain resection from April 2014 (Specimen B) demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.   Sections of the right temporal brain resection from June 2014 (Specimen A) shows necrosis and foreign material with no glioblastoma identified, confirmed on a GFAP stain. CLINICAL HISTORY:  From an extraction of the electronic medical record, we find Oscar Alvarado has a past medical history of craniotomy and resection of right temporal tumor in April 2013 showing glioblastoma (slides under current review). Subsequently he had chemotherapy and radiation, postoperative infection requiring repeat craniotomy and evacuation of intracranial fluid collection and repeat right craniotomy and tumor resection for recurrent GBM on June 2013 (slides under current review).

The current biopsies show no definite neoplasm however occasional atypical cells are seen that raise consideration for an infiltrate of neoplastic glial cells.  Additionally, an isolated microscopic focus of necrosis is identified in specimen A.

Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides from this case and concurs with the diagnoses. MICROSCOPIC:  Specimen A shows a microscopic a focus of necrosis and gray matter with no definite neoplasm.   Sections B and C show fragments of gray and white matter with no definite neoplasm. Immunohistochemistry is prepared on sections from parts Occasional atypical glial cells with angular nuclei and occasional angular Ki-67 positive nuclei are seen on immunohistochemical staining (block C1) that raise consideration for infiltrating glioma.

BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LESION, RESECTION ASPIRATE --   NECROSIS AND REACTIVE CHANGES --   NO DEFINITE GLIAL NEOPLASM (SEE COMMENT) BARRY-HOLSON/BORN COMMENT:  In addition to prominent necrosis, there are several cellular areas (slides A6 and A8) that prove to be a mixture of macrophages and other inflammatory cells by immunohistochemistry. While we do not identify a cellular neoplasm, it is likely that a portion of the many atypical cells represent a small population of neoplastic glial cells. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections of the resection and aspirate specimens (parts A and B) show gray and white matter with predominantly normal cellularity with large areas of geographic necrosis. There are several areas in the resection specimen (part A) that have increased cellularity due to collections of macrophages, small blood vessels, inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) and atypical, hard to classify, somewhat spindled, cells. The most suspicious areas are on slides A6 and A8 and immunohistochemistry was therefore prepared on sections from these blocks to characterize the infiltrate and evaluate for a residual glial neoplasm. The majority of cells in these areas are CD163 positive macrophages with smaller numbers of admixed CD45RB-positive mononuclear cells and scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive glial cells. Overall, the Ki67 proliferation marker shows varying portions of immunoreactive nuclei (0-10% of cells) in the cellular areas.  There is one focus of clustered GFAP immunoreactive cells (A6) where there is no accompanying increase in Ki67 immunoreactive nuclei.  Outside of the cellular areas, the GFAP immunohistochemistry shows regularly spaced stellate astrocytes with tapered processes, consistent with reactive gliosis. Additionally, scattered small suture granulomas characterized by a foreign body giant cell reaction and cholesterol clefts are noted throughout both specimens. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 45 year old male with history of a right temporal GBM, MGMT negative, s/p initial resectionÂ 4/17/2013 (see SHS-14-27872 for our slide review report) followed by chemo/radiation therapy.  After radiologic evidence of a recurrence, repeat right craniotomy was performedÂ 6/17/14Â with pathology showing some atypical cells but no definite neoplasm (see SHS-14-24661). Recent MRIÂ and PET demonstrates increasing nodular enhancement,, approximately 1.8 x 0.8 cm, along the posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe resection cavity. OPERATION: Right craniotomy for tumor resection GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""right temporal lobe"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple pieces of unoriented pink-tan-yellow brain tissue, measuring 5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes A1 to A9.

The patient pursued alternative treatment options without success. He returns to Stanford with re-growth of tumor by MRI and clinical findings.  OPERATION:  Right temporal craniotomy. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent glioblastoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name ""Zugman"" and the medical record number.  The specimen labeled ""right temporal brain tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of a 1.6 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm aggregate of irregular, focally hemorrhagic, tan-pink soft tissue, which is submitted in toto in A1. Breitweser for neuropath/jt The second specimen is received in formalin and labeled ""additional tissue"".  It consists of a total of 23 grams of brain tissue that measures approximately 4 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm.  15.5 grams of this tissue is banked in the tissue bank.  The remaining tissue measures 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm in aggregate and consists of two fragments of pale tan, focally hemorrhagic brain tissue.  The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes B1-B3.   Woolf for Neuropath/mv (part 2) MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  We have reviewed the patient's prior brain biopsy (SHS-05-16205) and confirm the diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Histologic sections of the current specimen submitted as Â¿right temporal tumorÂ¿ reveal similar features to those seen in the prior biopsy namely a highly cellular, mitotically active, infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm.  Multiple foci of microvascular proliferation and necrosis are present.  In addition, in block B, there is a prominent Â¿oligodendroglial-likeÂ¿ pattern in which the neoplastic cells display rounder nuclei and are surrounded by clear cytoplasm reminiscent of the Â¿fried eggÂ¿ appearance of an oligodendroglioma. COMMENT:   FISH analysis for 19q and 1p deletions will be performed on block B and the results  issued as an addendum.

SKIN BIOPSY, BACK CLINICAL HISTORY:   62-year-old male with glioblastoma multiforme on Keppra treatment x one month with 6-day history of spreading erythematous papules ? some with dusky centers involving palms, trunk, extremities. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  EM versus drug eruption.  Doubt viral eruption versus Sweet's syndrome. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen labeled as ""back"" is received in formalin and consists of a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm tan, circular skin which is bisected and submitted in its entirety in cassette A1 (PASd tag).   Ruiz for Derm/amp COMMENT:  Multiple step-leveled sections of this back biopsy reveal an incomplete form of granuloma annulare resulting from a diffuse interstitial infiltrate of histiocytes and lymphocytes surrounding piecemeal fragmentation of collagen and elastic fibers. The dermis shows superficial and mid perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with pools of mucin, and no neutrophilic infiltration is seen. An Alcian blue stain highlights pools of dermal mucin. The epidermis is unremarkable and no apoptotic keratinocytes are seen on multiple levels examined. These findings show an interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with an incomplete form of granuloma annulare-like tissue reaction pattern and do not support erythema multiforme or Sweet's syndrome. Although the etiology of granuloma annulare remains uncertain, possible triggering events include drugs, viruses (herpes) and insect bites.

It consists of approximately 50 cc of serosanguineous fluid and numerous fragments of gray and white soft tissue measuring approximately 4.0 cc.  The tissue fragments are entirely submitted in three cassettes labelled B1-B3.  /zt MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections from both specimens show fragments of cortical white and grey matter that are focally infiltrated by a cellular glial neoplasm.  The tumor cells show a range of appearances.  In most areas the tumor cells have oval to elongated or fusiform nuclei with scant to moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. In other areas the tumor cells are more pleomorphic with bizarre multinucleated forms showing moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. In some foci, the tumor cells have relatively round nuclei, granular chromatin and perinuclear clearing, suggesting an oligodendroglial component (best seen in specimen #2).  Focal perineuronal satellitosis is present.  Mitotic figures are easily identified. Vascular proliferation is seen.  Geographic areas of necrosis and hyalinized vessels are abundant.

We agree with your diagnostic impression. The tumor is a glioblastoma negative for IDH1 R132H by immunohistochemistry. The WHO 2016 suggests that glioblastomas in patients > 54 years (without prior lower-grade glioma) may be designated ""IDH-wildtype"", even in the absence of IDH sequencing, due to the rarity of non-canonical IDH mutations in this age group (<1%). MGMT promoter methylation testing is initiated and the results will be reported in an addendum. Dr. Don Born has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections show an infiltrative glial neoplasm composed of cells with pleomorphic nuclei and fibrillary processes. Microvascular proliferation and increased mitotic activity (4 per 10 HPF) are noted. There is no necrosis. The submitted immunohistochemistry slide shows the neoplastic cells are positive for GFAP. IDH1 R132H immunostain was performed at Stanford Health and shows the neoplastic cells are negative (wild-type).

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 74-year-old man with an elevated PSA of 5.1 and a benign clinical exam who underwent prostate core biopsies.  This case is received in consultation from Dr. Joseph Wand at the Chanate Medical Laboratory in Santa Rosa, California. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this difficult case in consultation. We agree with your impression.  Review of the prostate core biopsy reveals predominantly benign prostatic tissue with stromal hyperplasia and glandular atrophy.  In the left central apex there is a proliferation of atypical glands which show crowding and back-to-back architecture but maintain well circumscribed glandular contours.  These glands are lined by cells with enlarged nuclei, some of which have prominent large nucleoli.  The lumens contain eosinophilic glandular secretions and crystalloids.  These features are concerning for a prostatic adenocarcinoma.  In order to further investigate this process, a combined racemase and p63 stain was performed at Stanford University.  This shows weak cytoplasmic staining for racemase and loss of the normal basal cell layer, confirming the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

Specimens #1 and #3 are received fresh, and specimen #2 is received in a formalin-filled container. Specimen #1 designated as ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of two pieces of tan-mucoid tissue, each measuring 0.7 cm in largest dimension.  A touch prep is performed (TPA).  A portion is frozen as FSA and not exhausted.  The remainder of the specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette XA1. Specimen #2 designated as ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of a 10.5 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm segment of brain cortex.  On the outer surface is gray matter covered by transparent leptomeninges. The inner surface demonstrates shaggy, hemorrhagic white matter.  Serial sectioning the specimen demonstrates a clear white/gray matter interface. There are multiple hemorrhages throughout the cortex.  No discrete tumor mass is identified.  Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B6. Specimen #3 designated ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of two pieces of gray mucoid tissue that aggregate to 2.3 x 2 x 1.1 cm.  A portion is submitted for cytogenetics.  A touch prep is performed (TPB). The remainder of the specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette C1.    Tan/mv MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses. Sections of specimen A demonstrate a neoplasm of relatively low cellularity composed of cells with generally rounded nuclei.  Some cells have mini-gemistocytic features.  The neoplasm infiltrates through white matter and cortex where there is evidence of malignant satellitosis.  There is focal minimal vascular proliferation in these sections and scattered mitoses are seen. The sections of specimen B demonstrate a neoplasm of variable cellularity.  The tumor is markedly cellular in slide B6.  In this section the tumor has prominent nuclear pleomorphism and a brisk mitotic figures.  The tumor infiltrates through the cortex producing subpial mounds.  Exuberant perineuronal and perivascular satellitosis is present.  There is at least focal vascular proliferation.  The tumor in the other sections is less cellular with more regular appearing nuclei.  In these sections there is prominent white matter edema and recent hemorrhages. The sections of specimen C demonstrate a densely cellular neoplasm composed of cells of variable appearance.  In some regions the cells resemble an oligodendroglioma with relatively uniform round nuclei. In other areas, the cells acquire features of a gemistocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  A substantial portion of the specimen is composed of cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and a brisk mitotic rate.  Vascular proliferation is prominent in these sections.

Specimens #1 and #3 are received fresh, and specimen #2 is received in a formalin-filled container. Specimen #1 designated as ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of two pieces of tan-mucoid tissue, each measuring 0.7 cm in largest dimension.  A touch prep is performed (TPA).  A portion is frozen as FSA and not exhausted.  The remainder of the specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette XA1. Specimen #2 designated as ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of a 10.5 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm segment of brain cortex.  On the outer surface is gray matter covered by transparent leptomeninges. The inner surface demonstrates shaggy, hemorrhagic white matter.  Serial sectioning the specimen demonstrates a clear white/gray matter interface. There are multiple hemorrhages throughout the cortex.  No discrete tumor mass is identified.  Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B6. Specimen #3 designated ""frontal brain tumor"", consists of two pieces of gray mucoid tissue that aggregate to 2.3 x 2 x 1.1 cm.  A portion is submitted for cytogenetics.  A touch prep is performed (TPB). The remainder of the specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette C1.    Tan/mv MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses. Sections of specimen A demonstrate a neoplasm of relatively low cellularity composed of cells with generally rounded nuclei.  Some cells have mini-gemistocytic features.  The neoplasm infiltrates through white matter and cortex where there is evidence of malignant satellitosis.  There is focal minimal vascular proliferation in these sections and scattered mitoses are seen. The sections of specimen B demonstrate a neoplasm of variable cellularity.  The tumor is markedly cellular in slide B6.  In this section the tumor has prominent nuclear pleomorphism and a brisk mitotic figures.  The tumor infiltrates through the cortex producing subpial mounds.  Exuberant perineuronal and perivascular satellitosis is present.  There is at least focal vascular proliferation.  The tumor in the other sections is less cellular with more regular appearing nuclei.  In these sections there is prominent white matter edema and recent hemorrhages. The sections of specimen C demonstrate a densely cellular neoplasm composed of cells of variable appearance.  In some regions the cells resemble an oligodendroglioma with relatively uniform round nuclei. In other areas, the cells acquire features of a gemistocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.  A substantial portion of the specimen is composed of cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and a brisk mitotic rate.  Vascular proliferation is prominent in these sections.  Additionally there are several areas of serpiginous necrosis with pseudopallisading.

The specimen measures 0-.2 x 0.3 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is tan/gray and soft in consistency.  A portion is taken for frozen section.  The portion of that not used in now submitted in cassette FS1.  The portion not taken for frozen section is submitted in cassette X1. The second specimen is received fresh from the Operating Room, labeled ""left frontal lobe biopsy"".  The specimen is a tan/white fragment of tissue, measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2cm.  A small portion is taken for frozen section.  The remainder of that is submitted in cassette FS2.  The portion not used in frozen section is now submitted in cassette X2. The third specimen is received fresh from the Operating Room, labeled ""left frontal lobe biopsy"".  It contains a single fragment of red/tan tissue, measuring 0.2 x 0.4 x 0.3cm.  It is entirely submitted in cassette A. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections of the left frontal lobe biopsy show a tumor invading the superficial cortex.  The tumor is present in a fibrillary background. Secondary structures of Scherer are readily apparent.  Many of the tumor cells have angulated nuclei but there are no mitotic figures present. Immunohistochemistry:  The suspicious nuclei stain intensely with p53 while some other nuclei stain lighter.  GFAP stain shows a dense positive fibrillary background; however, most of the cells with abnormal nuclei do not display GFAP positive cell processes.

BRAIN, LEFT OCCIPITAL, BIOPSY --   MALIGNANT GLIOMA FAVOR EPITHELIOID GLIOBLASTOMA WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) CLAY/KUNDER/VOGEL COMMENT:  On morphologic grounds, the differential diagnosis includes gemistocytic astrocytoma, granular cell astrocytoma, epithelioid glioblastoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, rhabdoid meningioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and a primary leptomeningeal melanoma. Overall, the findings support the diagnosis of a malignant glioma, and given the epithelioid morphology, an epithelioid glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Molecular testing for BRAF has been initiated and will be reported in epic. We have reviewed the frozen section material and agree with the diagnosis rendered at that time. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections of the two specimens are similar and are described together.  The lesion is composed of sheets of discohesive cells with eccentric nuclei and prominent eosinophilic, inclusion-like cytoplasmic bellies, which deform many the nuclei. Many cells are binucleate, with coarse chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli.  Intranuclear cytoplasmic invaginations are frequently identified.  There are areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemistry shows the lesion to show cytoplasmic S100 positivity and clusters of GFAP-postive cells predominantly in a perivascular distribution in which there is also nuclear S100 positivity. The cells are also INI1 positive, myogenin and desmin negative.

OPERATION:   Stealth-guided brain tumor biopsy. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FSA: BRAIN, RIGHT, BIOPSY      --   SUSPICIOUS FOR INFILTRATING GLIOMA FSB: BRAIN, RIGHT, BIOPSY      --   MALIGNANT GLIOMA                (Ortanez/Mobley/Vogel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:   Both specimens are received fresh labeled with the patient name ""Aaron Daniel Anderson"". The first specimen additionally labeled ""FSA"" consists of three tan-pink soft tissue cores measuring 2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm.  A portion of the tissue is frozen.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is subsequently submitted for permanents in cassette A1. The tissue that is not frozen is entirely submitted in cassette A2. The second specimen additionally labeled ""FSB"" consists of two pale tan tissue cores that aggregate to 1.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm; plus one fragment of blood that measures less than 0.1 cm in greatest diameter.  A portion of the tissue is frozen.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is subsequently submitted for permanent sections in a cassette labeled B1.  The tissue that is not frozen is entirely submitted in cassette B2.   Velasquez for Neuropath/mkb MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen sections and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment. Permanent sections of the second right frontal biopsy demonstrate a cellular proliferation of highly atypical astrocytic cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic angulated nuclei.  These atypical astrocytes are seen in a background demonstrating vascular proliferation.  While the sampled tumor does not demonstrate necrosis, and though mitotic figures are inconspicuous, the cellularity of the lesion, along with the degree of cytologic atypia and vascular proliferation is most compatible with a diagnosis of glioblastoma.

HANNES VOGEL M.D. Electronically signed 07/02/2008 10:48AM ***ADDENDUM*** An addendum is issued to this report to permit comment on additional immunohistochemical results.  The original diagnosis remains unchanged. At the request of Dr. Recht, immunohistochemical stains for Ki-67 and P53 are performed.  Ki-67 highlights approximately 10% of the malignant cells overall, and stains up to 15% of cells in the most proliferative areas.  P53 demonstrates nuclear staining in approximately 5 to 10% of cells. Both Ki-67 and P53 label fewer malignant cells than would be expected of a typical glioblastoma.  The degree of vascular proliferation, which remains present on deeper levels, continues to be most consistent with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. This patient has a history of neurofibromatosis.  The behavior of glioblastoma in patients with neurofibromatosis, as compared to the general population, has not been fully elucidated, and these tumors may behave differently in this subset of patients. These results were discussed with Dr. Recht at 3 p.m. on July 8, 2008. This case will also be sent for additional consultation to Dr. Arie Perry, and the results of this additional consultation will be issued as an addendum.

HANNES VOGEL M.D. Electronically signed 07/10/2008 11:48AM ***ADDENDUM*** This addendum is issued to permit comment on the results of additional consultation from Dr. Arie Perry of Washington University in St. Louis, as well as the results of additional review of this case at UCSF Medical Center.  The original diagnosis remains unchanged. Dr. Perry notes in his consult report that he essentially agrees with our impression, and that the findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of a ""high-grade astrocytic neoplasm"".  His impression of the biopsy is that of anaplastic astrocytoma, however he cautions that these findings may also represent and under-sampled glioblastoma. Dr. Perry also notes that there is limited clinical experience regarding patients with NF-1 and high-grade gliomas, however preliminary data suggests that the behavior of these tumors in NF-1 patients is similar to sporadic counterparts. This case was also reviewed by the neuropathology department at UCSF Medical Center.  They note the tumor's hypercellularity, nuclear pleomorphism, and the multiple foci of microvascular proliferation. In their review they also note their interpretation of the immunohistochemical stains performed at Stanford, and report a Ki-67 labeling index of 10%, and P53 positivity in approximately 15% of neoplastic astrocytic nuclei.  Their overall impression is that of glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). This is a challenging case.  The findings are undoubtedly those of a high-grade astrocytic neoplasm.  The relatively low Ki-67 index and degree of P53 staining are unusual for a glioblastoma, however the morphologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Clinical correlation is suggested. These findings were discussed with Dr. Recht on Monday July 21, 2008.

The original diagnosis remains unchanged. ADDENDUM COMMENT:  Dr. Yong agrees with the diagnosis of glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Immunohistochemical stains demonstrate PTEN deficiency, reported as approximately Â¿70% deficientÂ¿.  Dr. Yong comments that in a retrospective clinical study of glioblastoma, deficient PTEN was found to be associated with a diminished response to EGFR kinase inhibitors (Mellinghoff et al, New England Journal of Medicine 2005, 353 (19): 2012-2024), but the association was not absolute.  The appropriate choice of therapy, if at any, and the timing thereof should be decided after considering all clinical and pathologic factors. Per e-mail conversation with Dr. Yong, the tumor demonstrates positive EGFRv3 staining; this study was performed as a nonclinical tool, however, and therefore is not described in the consultation report.

BRAIN, RIGHT SUPERIOR TEMPORAL LOBE, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, FAVOR EPITHELIOID TYPE, WHO GRADE IV BAYAT/HOFFMANN/RIEGER/VOGEL COMMENT:  .Several diagnoses were considered in this unusual case. Because of the variable GFAP staining, gliosarcoma is a possibility however the overall appearance is atypical and is more reminiscent of an epithelioid glioblastoma. The patchy GFAP and more diffuse S-100 immunostaining is characteristic. In a recent series of 13 cases, 7 were BRAF V600E mutant (Am J Surg Path 2013, 37, 685-698) Because of the location, age, focal histological appearance, and BRAF V600E abnormality by immunohistochemistry, a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) was considered however the malignant features seen in this case would not be compatible with the usual WHO Grade II assignment, and as anaplastic PXA has not yet been codified by the WHO, the grade is indeterminate but would be equivalent to WHO Grade III or IV. . Molecular genetic analysis of the BRAF V600E mutation is being performed and results will be issued in an addendum. Dr. Rieger (Dermatopathology) reviewed the slides and concurs that a melanoma is unlikely. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slide and concur. Histologic sections reveal a cellular neoplasm with large cells with nuclei of variable size and shape and prominent nucleoli. Many of the cells are rounded with eccentric displacement of the nuclei by prominent cytoplasmic contents. Necrosis is also prominent.  S100 is positive, GFAP is focally positive; MelanA and HMB45 are negative, and p53 is focally nuclearly positive.  IDH-1 staining is negative. BRAF immunostaining for the V600E mutation and INI1 are diffusely positive.  Reticulin staining shows a focal lobular pattern and some areas of pericellular deposition, but the majority of the tumor is reticulin-negative. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per Epic, the patient is a 26 yo male with longstanding mental health issues with current diagnosis of bipolarism presenting with nausea/vomiting, and decreased LOC found to have a large right temporal brain tumor with hemorrhagic components, now status post resection.

Although areas with pericellular reticulin staining do not alternate with GFAP rich regions, we favor the interpretation that the present resection represents gliosarcoma, WHO grade IV. Clinical and radiologic correlation is recommended. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  We have reviewed the prior biopsy specimen (SHS-12-3931) and concur with the diagnosis rendered. The histologic sections of the tumor (specimen A) show diffuse, malignant spindle proliferation with nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic figures. The immunohistochemical stains are performed, and the lesional cells are positive for S100, and negative for p53, IDH1 (R132H), EMA, and STAT6. ATRX expression is retained. The GFAP stain shows focal faint staining. Compared with the reticulin stain, the GFAP-weakly positive areas relatively lack of reticulin, while the reticulin-rich areas are negative for GFAP staining. There is no definite gliosarcoma present on the deep margin biopsy (specimen B). Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

He was initially diagnosed at an outside hospital in March 2011 with a solitary plasmacytoma of the lumbar spine. At time of diagnosis, his bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular bone marrow with normal trilineage hematopoiesis, no evidence of increased plasma cells, normal cytogenetics and a negative myeloma FISH panel. He received 44 Gy of radiotherapy to his lower lumbar spine on 5/23/11. He has been followed every 3-6 months with labs and annual PET scans and had a slowly progressing increase in paraprotein levels. In February/March 2015, routine PET scan and skeletal survey showed multiple lytic lesions predominately localized to the cervical and lumbar spinal bodies. At this time, a FNA of his left acromion process (3/26/15) showed features consistent with a plasma cell neoplasm, whereas a bone marrow aspirate (3/26/15) showed no immunophenotypic abnormalities by flow cytometry and a negative multiple myeloma FISH panel. He has now completed 5 cycles of RVD therapy since 4/13/15 and his paraprotein levels have since improved (a decrease by >50%), suggestive of a partial response. However, his most recent PET scan on 6/26/15 showed metabolic and anatomic progression of multiple lytic lesions consistent with a progression of his myeloma. In August 2015, lenalidomide was discontinued due to a rash and he has continued on bortezomib and dexamethasone. Additional medical history of note includes intermediate risk prostate cancer now s/p prostatectomy in April 2008 and in remission. Eleven slides corresponding to the FNA of the left acromion process performed on 3/26/15 are received for our review at the request of Dr. Ginna Laport. FNA LEFT ACROMION (PN15-00388, 3/26/2015): MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic sections of the left acromion show predominately blood clot with focal areas consisting of sheets of plasma cells. The plasma cells display mature morphologies. The lesional cells are expressing CD138, lamba and vimentin and are equivocally expressing CD117 (c-kit). The lesional cells are negative for kappa, cytokeratin AE1/3 cytokeratin7, cytokeratin 20, Pax-8 and PSA. Overall, these findings are consistent with a plasma cell neoplasm. Â  I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. ROBERT OHGAMI M.D., Ph.D. Pathologist Electronically signed 9/4/2015 12:54 PM   ACCESSION NUMBER: SHS-15-38573"

The original report had the diagnosis ""INFILTRATING GLIOMA"" and this is revised to ""GLIOBLASTOMA.  Altered text and an Amendment Comment is present in italics. DIAGNOSIS: BRAIN, RIGHT POSTERIOR FRONTAL LOBE TUMOR, BIOPSY (PS-20-11109; 12/29/2020) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILD-TYPE, WHO GRADE 4 TOLAND/AHMADIAN/BORN AMENDMENT COMMENT:  As described in the addendum based on update 3 of the cIMPACT-NOW criteria the finding of a TERT promoter mutation in a glioma lacking an IDH mutation, is sufficient for a diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation. We agree with your diagnostic impression. The histologic sections are most consistent with a diffuse astrocytoma. However, the patient's age, imaging features, and lack of IDH1 R132H mutation raise suspicion for a small sampling of glioblastoma. Next generation sequencing is initiated to search for additional alterations which would affect the diagnosis and prognosis (i.e. IDH mutation, TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, and/or chromosome 7 gain/10 loss). Results will be reported in an addendum. Dr. Vogel has reviewed the case and agrees with the diagnosis Angus Toland communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Duncan on 01/05/2020 MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show a proliferation of mildly to moderately atypical glial cells infiltrating the background brain parenchyma. One focus is suspicious, but not definite for microvascular proliferation. No mitotic figures or foci of necrosis are identified. Immunohistochemistry prepared at Stanford on sections from the provided block show IDH1 R132H is negative (not mutated). CLINICAL HISTORY: 66-year-old man with 12 enhancing nodules in the right posterior frontal/parietal/temporal region with marked surrounding vasogenic edema, the largest measuring 3.9 x 1.9 cm. Given that all the nodules cluster in the same adjacent location, the possibility of multifocal glioblastoma is considered. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Four stained slides and one paraffin tissue block labeled ""PS-20-11109"" are received from Sutter Health Mills Peninsula ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to describe the results of next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the Stanford Solid Tumor Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP), version 2.6.2.

Sections of specimen C reveal a proliferation of malignant glia with ovoid to angular hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli and variably gemistocytic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is noted. Microvascular proliferation is present, but definite necrosis is not seen. The section of specimen B reveals a focus of glia which are cytomorphologically consistent with the above, but otherwise predominantly consists of mildly gliotic brain. No definite tumor cells are seen on permanent sections of specimen A, although we see a few scattered atypical glia. IDH1 (R132H) is negative in tumor cells, while ATRX is positive (retained). P53 is predominantly negative. MGMT studies have been ordered on the deeper brain biopsy with glioblastoma (specimen C), and the results will be reported in EPIC. The case was discussed at adult Neuro Oncology Tumor board on 10/21/16. Dr. Donald Born has reviewed the slides and agrees with our diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: 66-year-old male, who has a history of coronary artery disease status post quadruple bypass surgery in 2015. On September 26, 2016, he developed new onset of generalized tonic clonic seizure and was taken to an outside hospital. During his hospitalization, he had a brain CT which revealed a possible right frontal brain mass, measuring approximately 16 x 20 x 23 mm. On a repeat MRI there was increased T2 signal on FLAIR along the right frontal lobe in the ACA territory with a punctate focus of enhancement in the right precentral gyrus which is not associated with abnormal FLAIR signal abnormality.

The first specimen labeled ""left temporal brain tumor"" is received fresh and consists of four soft tan tissue fragments that aggregate to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 m.  The cut surface of one piece is tan and homogeneous.  A touch prep is made.  A representative section is submitted for frozen section and resubmitted in cassette A1.  The remaining tissue is submitted in cassette A2. The second specimen is not labeled as to the source, is received fresh, and consists of a 5 x 3 x 2 cm aggregate of soft tan-gray tissue.  Three quarters of the specimen is submitted for research. The remaining tissue is sectioned and submitted in four cassettes labeled B1-B4. The third specimen labeled ""CUSA sock content brain tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of a fabric sock-like device that contains a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2 cm aggregate of soft tan-gray tissue. Representative tissue is submitted in three cassettes labeled C1-C3. Singel (9/13/2018) I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL MASS, BIOPSY --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH R132H WILD TYPE, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) MOONEY/LUMMUS/LAVEZO/VOGEL/BORN COMMENT:  Although there are numerous eosinophilic granular bodies, the features overall favor glioblastoma. MGMT promotor methylation testing is pending, and results will be conveyed in the electronic medical record. Dr. Vogel has reviewed the case and concurs. Dr. Li was notified of the diagnosis at approximately 6:15 PM on 4/4/2018. MICROSCOPIC:  The smear preparation was reviewed, and we agree with the intraoperative diagnosis rendered.  H&E stained sections of the paraffin embedded tissue demonstrate a moderately cellular lesion composed of astrocytes with nuclear pleomorphism and variable hyperchromasia. Eosinophilic granular bodies are seen, including eosinophilic globules within tumor cell cytoplasm.   There is microvascular proliferation. Mitoses are present and enumerate up to 2 per high power field. Some areas exhibit more epithelioid morphology. No overt necrosis is seen. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells exhibit patchy p53 staining (wild type), and are negative for IDH R132H (wild type), have retained ATRX staining (wild type). Alpha-1 anti-trypsin highlights eosinophilic granular bodies. BRAF (V600E) is negative, providing no support for epithelioid glioblastoma. A reticulin stain shows no pericellular staining in the tumor, providing no support for pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. CD163 stain is negative in the tumor cells but highlights numerous reactive microglia and macrophages.  CD68 is positive in a small proportion of tumor cells, but most are negative, with most of the CD68 immunoreactivity associated with macrophages, providing no support for granular cell astrocytoma. A CLINICAL HISTORY: Per requisition form, 66-year-old male with brain lesion. As extracted from the medical record, the patient has multifocal heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the superficial aspect of the left temporal lobe with associated surrounding increased T1/FLAIR signal and localized swelling.

He underwent a left temporal craniotomy on 8/31 with Dr. Chang for resection of this 3x3 cm L temporoparietal mass with near complete resection. Post-op MRI showed some residual enhancement around the border of the resection cavity. During the intervening few weeks, he has had complaints of persistent headaches and nausea. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Two specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name, Jeffrey Kasten, and medical record number. The first specimen is additionally labeled ""brain tumor"" and consists of multiple tan-brown hemorrhagic fragments that aggregate to 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm.  The specimen is wrapped in tissue paper and entirely submitted in cassette A1. The second specimen is additionally labeled ""cusa specimen"" and consists of multiple yellow-tan hemorrhagic fragments that aggregate to 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm.  The majority of the specimen is submitted in cassette B1.   Weinzierl for Neuropath/sv MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the prior case (SHS-09-29586) and agree with diagnosis rendered.  In this current case, H&E sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. Occasional mitotic figures are identified.  Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  There is also microscopic evidence of the previous surgical resection. It should be noted that these classic morphologic features of glioblastoma are not apparent in the previous case (SHS-09-29586), and it may be that the current specimen is more representative of the lesion.

The first specimen labeled ""brain tumor"" is received fresh and consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm aggregate of irregular tan-pink tissue.  The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA) and not exhausted.  The frozen section residue is submitted in A1.

The remainder of the specimen is submitted in B2.   Breitweser for Neuropath/ai/sf MICROSCOPIC:  Sections of specimen A demonstrates a moderately cellular astrocytic neoplasm with round to ovoid nuclei, course chromatin and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Significant cytologic atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis is not identified. Sections of specimen B show a biphasic pattern with dense fibrous fascicles intermixed with more cellular gliomatous areas.  Also noted are prominent areas of geographic coagulative necrosis however without microvascular proliferation or mitotic activity. A P53 immunohistochemical stain is negative while Ki-67 shows patchy reactivity, up to 30% in some ares.  The morphologic findings raise the possibility of gliosarcoma.  A GFAP immunostain is negative in the fibrous areas however a reticulin stain fails to highlight significant reticulin fibers within the fibrous bands as is typical of gliosarcoma. COMMENT:  This is a challenging and difficult case.  We have reviewed the outside slides (S-09-05685) and note a cellular proliferation of glial cells with varying degrees of microvascular proliferation, and no significant necrosis or mitotic activity, however, Ki-67 immunostain focally shows a high proliferation rate. We essentially agree with the outside pathologist's interpretation of high grade glioma.  The current resection specimen from the temporal lobe does not show diagnostic features of high-grade astrocytoma, however given the pathological features noted in the recent resection described above, probably represents sampling artifact within a malignant astrocytoma. The presence cytological atypia and high proliferation rate in the left parietal love biopsy are consistent with a high grade astrocytoma.  Based on the histologic findings exact grading is difficult but at least WHO Grade III. Clinical correlation is required.

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of nodular lymphocyte rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (SHS-02-0036) and a reported history of acute myeloid leukemia, who is status-post therapy and in remission.  He now has a colonoscopic biopsy with an atypical lymphoid infiltrate interpreted as consistent with MALT lymphoma. COMMENT:  We agree with the submitting pathologist's interpretation, and the findings from immunohistochemical and molecular studies performed at Stanford are consistent with extranodal marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma.  However, the biopsy is small, and we suggest clinical correlation and correlation with imaging studies to confirm the presence of a mass lesion. The single submitted H&E-stained slide shows a small fragment of colonic mucosa with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate extending into the mucosa with focal gland destruction.  Large follicles with demonstrable tingible-body macrophages are seen at the deep aspect of the lesion.  A monocytoid component is not readily demonstrable. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Stanford to evaluate for lymphoma.  A stain for CD20 highlights the majority of the lymphocytes and shows a sheet-like pattern.  A stain for CD43 highlights T-rich areas around the B-cells and shows no aberrant co-expression within the B-cells.  A stain for CD21 highlights the follicles and shows that many B-cells are unassociated with follicles.  Stains for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains demonstrate polytypic plasma cells within the mucosa. The increased numbers of B-cells that are unassociated with follicles are suggestive of lymphoma.  Therefore, we submitted a paraffin-embedded tissue block for gene rearrangement studies at Stanford molecular pathology (W22514).

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia treated in 1997.   The patient has been in remission and now presents with a left jugular digastric lymph node. A fine needle aspiration showed atypical cells. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this case in consultation. Histologic sections from the jugular digastric lymph node demonstrate some residual secondary follicles with germinal centers and expansion of the mantle zones.  In the interfollicular areas, there are large atypical cells, some of which closely resemble Reed-Sternberg cells.  We also identify large atypical tumor cells within the follicular mantles.  We do not see a mixed inflammatory background, but instead, large numbers of lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes.  Morphologically, these findings raise concern for lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's disease. We have reviewed your immunohistochemical stains, and identify large aggregates of small B cells expressing CD20 and CD79a.  These markers highlight germinal centers with expanded follicles, but there is no expression by the large tumor cells.  CD43 and CD3 are expressed by background scattered T cells, which are primarily between the aggregates of B cells.  CD43 is also noted to highlight ringing of large atypical cells by T cells.  CD30 highlights numerous large cells within the follicle mantles as well as in the interfollicular areas, and more classical Reed-Sternberg cells are noted on this stain.  CD15 appears to highlight only granulocytes, however, with no expression by suspicious large tumor cells. In the absence of tumor cells staining for CD15, we have elected to repeat that study at Stanford; but, unfortunately ours is also noncontributory.  In addition, a CD21 stain performed in our laboratory highlights a follicular dendritic cell network in which we observe a significant number of large atypical cells. Given all of the above findings, it is our opinion that this lesion is best classified as lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's disease (which has been called follicular Hodgkin's disease by some).

We agree with the received diagnostic impressions. Per report the tumor was diffusely GFAP positive with a Ki-67 labeling index of 25%.  FISH revealed no evidence of 1p/19q co-deletion.  In light of the patient's age it may be relevant to perform testing for possible mutation of IDH, for which we would require a tissue block.  Likewise MGMT promoter methylation studies can be performed, with the same requirement of a tissue block. Further clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Sections of the tumor biopsies reveal an infiltrative neoplasm composed of malignant glia with oval to angulated nuclei, coarse chromatin and nuclear membrane irregularities. Mitotic activity is readily identified.  Both microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Extracting from the medical record we note that the patient is a 55 year old man who presented with visual disturbance, dizziness, headache, nausea/vomiting and was found on 3/11/15 right temporal resection to have glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. He is now status post XRT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ x 6.  In February, 2016 his MRI showed progression. He has received avastin x 2 and CCNU recently.  On 4/11/16, after avastin treatment, he had a fall and was sent for a CT scan which revealed what may be tumor progression and increased midline shift.

DIAGNOSIS: (go:sp:16-001331, 3/16/16) BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL LOBE, BIOPSY      --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV SAMGHABADI/VOGEL COMMENT:  Thank you for allowing us to review this case at the request of Dr. Seema Nagpal. We entirely agree with the submitted diagnosis. The outside section reveals an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with typical astrocytoid cytomorphology, e.g. ovoid to angulated hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin and nuclear contour irregularities. Mitotic activity is increased. The tumor cells are seen in a fibrillar background in association with abundant microvascular proliferation. There are some fields however where the neoplastic cells appear more epithelioid, raising the possibility of epithelioid glioblastoma. BRAF (V600E) was performed at Stanford to explore this possibility, but is negative. The results of MGMT promoter methylation studies by PCR will be reported in EPIC as they become available. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extracting from the outside pathology report, the patient is a 69 year old man who presented with changing mental status and was found to have multifocal brain lesions crossing the corpus callosum. The largest lesion is located in the left anterior frontal lobe and measures 3.8 cm in maximum dimension. The lesions show rim enhancement.

We agree with the submitted diagnosis. Dr. Peyman Samghabadi communicated the diagnosis to Doctors Gordon Li and Reena Thomas on 10/16/15. Dr. Hannes Vogel has seen the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: The submitted histologic sections reveal a neoplastic proliferation of malignant glia with oval to angulated and enlarged nuclei, coarse chromatin, nuclear contour irregularities and variable amounts of cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is easily discerned. Both necrosis and microvascular proliferation are present. Some foci demonstrate a nested, nodular architecture where the neoplastic cells demonstrate a more epithelioid morphology with smaller, somewhat eccentric nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the available clinical information Teresa Day is a 58 year old female with a right frontal lobe mass. Outside radiology revealed a cystic and contrast enhancing mass measuring 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lesion showed significant T2/FLAIR changes around it.

The CSF fluid shows fragments of infiltrating astrocytoma with marked cytologic anaplasia and microvascular proliferation. Although it is unusual to grade gliomas from tissue recovered from CSF, we feel that these features justify the diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV. Clinical and radiological correlation is strongly recommended. Dr. Vogel has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. Dr. Ziskin discussed the case with Dr. Lawrence on May 16, 2014. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate several fragments of acutely infarcted brain, areas with abundant macrophages, and several areas of poorly preserved tissue.  There are a few well preserved small fragments that show infiltrating astrocytoma with marked cytologic anaplasia. Mitotic activity is not seen in these miniscule tissue fragments. Microvascular proliferation is seen in the tumor fragments. No tumor necrosis is seen in the scant tissue. CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year-old male with memory changes and hydrocephalus.

We entirely agree with your diagnostic impressions. Dr. Peyman Samghabadi communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Elliot on 6/27/16. The prospect of further assessment of the oligodendroglioma-like foci was discussed and ultimately deferred as the alternate diagnosis (e.g. glioblastoma with small cell features) is of unknown clinical significance. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections reveal an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with enlarged and pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities and minimal cytoplasm. In some areas the tumor takes on a distinctive ""small cell"" appearance with further increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, nuclear molding and relative cytologic monotony. Mitotic activity is easily discerned, and we note both microvascular proliferation and necrosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the provided materials, we note that the patient is a 71 year old man with a right frontoparietal mass which is cystic, necrotic and ring-enhancing.

Permanent histologic sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei.  Mitotic figures are identified. Microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  These features support a diagnosis of recurrent/residual glioblastoma (see comment). MGMT promoter studies will be performed and reported in EPIC.

Aradillos (6/21/2011) MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and note the presence of recurrent glioma in the specimen that was used for frozen section A in a background of prominent reactive changes. Permanent sections of all 4 specimens show similar features and will be described together. These sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and areas of pseudopalisading necrosis. The adjacent white matter also shows reactive changes.

The histological interpretation was glioblastoma multiforme. She is currently receiving adjuvant radiation therapy. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received from Kaiser Permanente hospital (Redwood City, CA) are seven H&E stained slides (SR01-1883 A-G) and the corresponding pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The H&E stained slides demonstrate a highly pleomorphic glial neoplasm in the deep white matter that is also invading the cortical gray matter. Many of the tumor cells appear to be aggregated in small groups or clumps. The tumor cells display polygonal, angulated, and occasionally round hyperchromatic nuclei with evenly dispersed chromatin. Occasional multinucleate giant cells, some of which show a ring-like distribution of malignant nuclei, are noted. Some gemistocytic and minigemistocytic tumor cells with eccentrically placed nuclei and moderate amounts of amphophilic cytoplasm are also present. Abundant abnormal mitotic figures are identified. Glomeruloid endothelial proliferation and pseudo-palisading necrosis are also present. COMMENT: We agree with the submitting pathologist's diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Immunohistochemical studies performed at Kaiser Permanente Hospital (San Francisco) reportedly demonstrate that the tumor cells are S100 positive and focally GFAP positive. The presence of occasional tumor cells with round nuclei suggests that the tumor may have an oligodendroglial component, or may have arisen from an oligodendroglioma.

A brain MRI study performed on April 10, 2008 demonstrated a large enhancing mass with central necrosis in the medial left frontal lobe with possible extension across the midline near the floor of the anterior cranial fossa.  He underwent resection on April 10th at the Northwest Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona (outside case NS-2357-08).  The originating pathologist describes a glioma with mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic features. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Twelve slides and two tissue blocks are received courtesy of Dr. Paul Vanatta of the Northwest Medical Center Department of Pathology.  The slides are labeled NS-2357-2008 and include hematoxin and eosin stained slides prepared from blocks FSA-2, FSB-2, and C1 through C4.  Squash preparations alternately stained with hematoxin and eosin and Diff-Quik are received for specimens A and B as well.  A copy of the outside pathology report is included.

This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis.  The above diagnosis remains unchanged. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two dual-color probe sets (Vysis) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Two hundred cells were scored for each probe set.  Abnormal 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns were observed in 10% and 1% of analyzed cells, respectively.  Normal 1p36 and 19q13 signal patterns were observed in 55.5% and 9.5% of nuclei, respectively. Hybridization with the 19q13 probe showed a large (60%) population of cells with three signals for both probe and internal control, suggesting trisomy #19. The remaining nuclei demonstrated low level variable patterns consistent with aneuploidy without relative deletion and/or sectioning error or hybridization inefficiency. The observed levels of deletion signal pattern are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

The histologic features are insufficient for a diagnosis of glioblastoma, however the forthcoming 2021 WHO CNS 5 recognizes molecular features of glioblastoma including TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, or trisomy 7/monosomy 10 which are sufficient for a diagnosis of IDH wild-type glioblastoma in the absence of conventional histology [Ref]. Molecular testing for MGMT promoter methylation as well as next-generation sequencing to evaluate for molecular features of glioblastoma have been ordered on block A1; the results are pending and will be reported as an addendum. Dr. Nirschl discussed the case with Dr. Jenny Kuo (Sequoia Pathology) on 09/15/2021 9:30, and the contributors have decided to pursue MGMT promoter methylation and next-generation sequencing for definitive classification as well as prognostication and risk stratification. Dr. Donald Born viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Reference: Louis DN, Perry A, et al. The 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: a summary.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The provided H&E stained sections show a cellular proliferation of atypical glial cells with irregular nuclear contours infiltrating background brain parenchyma. Mitotic activity is increased. No definite necrosis or microvascular proliferation are identified. Immuno-histochemical stains performed at Stanford on the provided block A1, which show neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H (wild-type). CLINICAL HISTORY:  According to the provided requisition and clinical documents: 67-year-old female with altered mental status and large, enhancing brain mass on imaging GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received are 1 slide and 1 block labeled 04-SP-21-2141 from Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, CA at the request of Dr. Taga. IMAGING FINDINGS (Brain MRI w/wo contrast, 8/30/2021): Enhancing parasagittal left frontal lobe mass extending across the anterior aspect of the corpus callosum measuring 4.7 x 4.3 x 3.7 with surrounding vasogenic edema ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A1, which contains approximately 40% tumor. ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to describe the results of MGMT promoter methylation as well as next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the UCSF 500 panel. MOLECULAR TESTING:  Samples from the neoplasm from block A1 were submitted for MGMT promoter methylation at Stanford Hospital and to the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory for next generation sequencing. The findings are as follows: A.  BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL LESION, MUTATIONAL PROFILING (04-SP-21-2141, PART A, 8/31/2021) --   POSITIVE FOR MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION (SEE COMMENT) --   POSITIVE FOR TERT c.-124C>T PROMOTER MUTATION (VAF= 19%) --   POSITIVE FOR EGFR AMPLIFICATION --   POSITIVE FOR EGFR vIII MUTATION (EXON 2-7 DELETION) --   TRISOMY CHROMOSOME 7, MONOSOMY CHROMOSOME 10 --   POSITIVE FOR CDKN2A, CDKN2B HOMOZYGOUS DELETION --   POSITIVE FOR MYCN AMPLIFICATION --   1 OF 86 MICROSATELLITES UNSTABLE (1.16%) --   TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN: 5.5 MUTATIONS/MB ADDENDUM COMMENT: All variants considered ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"" are reported here. Methylation-specific PCR is positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene via promoter hypermethylation in glioblastoma is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents, as well as for progression free survival, and overall survival (1-2). The next-generation sequencing results demonstrate the presence of a population of neoplastic cells with TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, and chromosomal alterations trisomy 7/monosomy 10, which are molecular features diagnostic for glioblastoma in the absence of mutations of IDH1/2 (3-4). Other alterations present such as CDKN2A/CDKN2B homozygous deletion are frequently reported in glioblastomas.

In our opinion, the histologic and immunophenotypic features are those of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  There are areas with very primitive morphology such that we consider this to be a PNET-like component, a feature in glioblastomas that has reported to portend an increased risk of remote subarachnoid spread and CSF seeding (see reference).  Dr. Vogel has viewed representative slides from this case and agrees with the diagnosis of glioblastoma.  If requested we will prepare IDH1 R132H mutation immunohistochemistry and MGMT promoter methylation studies. MICROSCOPIC:  Submitted histologic sections demonstrate a mitotically active, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei that are closely packed due to the with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, imparting a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) appearance.  Areas of pseudopalisading necrosis are identified as is microvascular proliferation.  The provided immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic cells are uniformly positive for GFAP and CD56. The neoplastic cells show scattered positive staining with pancytokeratin, EMA, and synaptophysin.   Additional immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells are negative for CD45, MART-1, and chromogranin.  The provided Ki-67 immunohistochemistry shows a high proportion of positive nuclei.

These findings support a diagnosis of glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV). CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the outside report, the patient is a 66 year old male with a brain tumor. Received for review are 3 H&E-stained slides, 3 paraffin blocks, 1 radiologic CD from Yavapai Regional Medical Center, Prescott, AZ courtesy of Dr. Michael Arroyo. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 9/11/2012 10:09 AM ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to incorporate the results of a MGMT promoter methylation study. The diagnosis of ""Glioblastoma, WHO Grade 4"" remains unchanged. This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. The MGMT promoter methylation test was interpreted by Dr. Franklin Mullins and performed at Stanford Clinical Laboratory, 3375 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, Dr Dan Arber, Laboratory Director.

We entirely agree with your interpretation of a glioblastoma. The histologic features are consistent with a small cell glioblastoma variant with EGFR gene amplification. MGMT promoter methylation has been initiated and will be reported in an addendum. IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. To exclude less common mutations in the IDH1 or in the IDH2 genes, and at request of the contributing pathologist, IDH mutation analysis can be performed with the Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP). Clinical and radiologic correlation is suggested. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections of the brain lesion demonstrate a malignant glial proliferation characterized by closely packed cells with small, mildly hyperchromatic nuclei with some nuclear molding, and minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background. Microvascular proliferation, frequent mitotic figures, and necrosis are identified. The immunohistochemical studies performed at Stanford (IDH1R132H, p53, ATRX and EGFR) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells do not express IDH1 R132H while EGFR and p53 (mutated) are positive in the tumor cells. ATRX is conserved (non-mutated) in the atypical glial cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 52 year old male who presents with a right temporal mass with peripheral enhancement. Clinical investigation also demonstrated a lung lesion. His past medical history includes substance abuse.

Infiltrative astrocytomas with granular cell features (granular cell astrocytomas): a study of histopathologic features, grading, and outcome. Am J Surg Pathol. 2002 26(6):750-7. MICROSCOPIC:  Provided histologic sections and our recuts demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by moderately pleomorphic epithelioid cells, frequently with eccentrically placed round/oval to angulated nuclei, vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.  A majority of the neoplastic cells have striking eosinophilic granular cytoplasm while others have somewhat vacuolated or fibrillary cytoplasm. Several foci of necrosis are seen, with some showing pseudopalisading necrosis. In one site there is microvascular proliferation and there are some blood vessels containing thrombus. A mitotic count is 3/10 high power fields and there are atypical mitotic figures..  There are foci of calcification.   The cytoplasm of the granular appearing cells is intensely demonstrated by the provided PASd stain. Provided reticulin stain shows no pericellular reticulin (highlights blood vessels).  Provided immunohistochemistry includes Ki-67 positive in 20-30% of the neoplastic nuclei and GFAP uniformly positive in the neoplastic cells (negative staining in focal microvascular proliferation). Additional immunohistochemistry prepared at Stanford on sections from the provided block show the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H mutation, BRAF V600E mutation and CD34;  ATRX immunoreactivity is preserved in neoplastic nuclei and p53 is equivocal as positive (some but inconsistent increased immunoreactivity),. CLINICAL HISTORY:  23-year-old female with 7.8 cm right parieto-occipital mass.  By outside report, imaging shows a mass with cystic, soft tissue, and calcified components, for which the initial differential includes ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma or pilocytic astrocytoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Thirteen slides and one block are received from Sunnyside Medical Center/Kaiser Permanente Northwest Laboratory in Portland.  These are labeled S15-23219 and the accompanying Pathology report lists this accession number for patient Sharon Rivera. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

This tumor is a glioblastoma with areas showing prominent, bizarre tumor giant cells.  Although isolated reports of more indolent behavior in glioblastoma with giant cells can be found in the literature1, the behavior of this class of glioblastomas has not been rigorously characterized. Reference 1. Shinojima, N, et al. The influence of sex and the presence of giant cells on postoperative long-term survival in adult patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. J Neurosurg 2004;101:219-226. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate an abundantly cellular astrocytic neoplasm characterized by cells with enlarged ovoid to elongate and angular nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of frequently vacuolated cytoplasm set within a fibrillar eosinophilic background with areas of sclerosis. Scattered mitotic figures, endothelial hyperplasia and pseudopalisading necrosis are seen.  Approximately 10% of the tumor shows abundant bizarre tumor giant cells.  Review of the outside immunohistochemical stains performed at Kaiser Permanente Redwood City Pathology demonstrates diffuse strong S100 staining positivity. A GFAP immunostain highlights the fibrillary tumor cell processes. Patchy light to moderate synaptophysin immunoreactivity is seen in areas with smaller tumor cells.  Large cells are synaptophysin negative.  A p53 immunostain is positive in a small proportion of giant cells but is overall negative in the tumor.  A Ki67 immunostain highlights a 5-10% proliferation index.  A CD34 immunostain is negative. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Received in consultation from Dr. Lawrence Smyth from Permanente Medical Group (Redwood City, CA), are six H&E stained slides and seven immunohistochemical stains from a right temporoparietal tumor (RWCS11-12219; 12/16/2011).

BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) HUGHES/PLOWEY/VOGEL COMMENT: The microscopy and apparent slow interval growth in this tumor are unusual for typical glioblastomas. There is no significant mitotic activity in most of the sampled tumor or pseudopalisading necrosis. Some areas show an unusual appearance reminiscent of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and for this reason, a mutational assay for BRAF will be performed. Clinical correlation is recommended. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slide and agree with the previously rendered intraoperative diagnosis.  Permanent histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic malignancy characterized by cells with variably hyperchromatic oblong and angular nuclei with rare scattered mitotic figures.  A prominent microvascular proliferation is identified as well as large areas of geographic necrosis.  Areas of the tumor that are in close proximity to the leptomeninges show exuberant collagen deposition (confirmed by a reticulin stain performed on Block A2) that represents leptomeningeal fibroblastic reaction to the tumor.

While the histologic features are compatible with glioblastoma, clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended.  Areas of this lesion show small cells that raise consideration for small cell glioblastoma however a FISH study performed at Stanford shows no evidence for EGFR amplification, providing no support for small cell glioblastoma. MICROSCOPIC:  The H&E stained slides from blocks B1 and C1 demonstrate a cellular, infiltrative, and malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and mild-moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by foci of microvascular proliferation and microvascular thrombosis.  The provided immunohistochemical stains for GFAP performed on blocks B and C show diffuse positive staining for GFAP with variable staining intensity. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with the EGFR probe set (Abbott Molecular) which identifies amplification of the EGFR gene on chromosome #7 and includes a chromosome #7 centromeric control probe (D7Z1). Unequivocal amplification is defined as innumerable EGFR signal (?10/cell) and an EGFR:Control ratio greater than 2.0.  Analysis of 100 nuclei was negative for amplification of the EGFR gene.  EGFR gene amplification is observed in glioblastoma. No. cells scored:   100 Average EGFR signals** / cell:     2.29 EGFR signal range:  1-4 Average Control signals / cell:    2.24 Control signal range:    1-4 EGFR:Control signal ratio:    1.02 *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year-old male with large pan-temporal mass, mainly involving the inferior temporal gyrus, with severe intracranial edema despite 1 g/kg of mannitol and 20 of Lasix. Patient combativeness, which did not allow for language mapping. The patient was attempting to remove himself from the pin apparatus and angrily refused to participate in the intraoperative testing. This limited the awake portion of the case to the inferior temporal gyrus and anterior temporal region. Gross inspection was consistent with glioblastoma. Postoperatively, the patient had more space with good relaxation of the brain following resection of the inferior temporal gyrus involved tumor.

BRAIN, RIGHT OCCIPITAL TUMOR #3, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV ZISKIN/VOGEL/BORN COMMENT:  We have reviewed the intraoperative frozen sections from parts A and B and confirm the previously rendered diagnoses.  H&E stained sections of the fixed tissue for parts A, C and D demonstrate an infiltrative, neoplastic glial proliferation characterized by variable morphologic features including many areas composed of packed nuclei with scant cytoplasm, areas of more spindled large cells, areas with sheets of gemistocytic cells and scattered large pleomorphic cells.  There are many examples of angular hyperchromatic nuclei.  There is mitotic activity, prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.  Part B has neoplastic infiltrates with prominent gemistocytic morphology but lacks microvascular proliferation and necrosis.  In the context of the present resection this probably represents a peripheral portion of glioblastoma.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are pending and will be reported in EPIC as the results become available. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides from this resection and concurs with the diagnoses. CLINICAL HISTORY: 65-year-old who was otherwise in good health until approximately 4 months ago when he noted visual flashing in the left visual field.

Krishnan for Neuropath/mkb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Review of the frozen section slides show rare atypical astrocytes exhibiting angulated, slightly enlarged nuclei.  On permanent sections, especially within the second tumor biopsy, similar appearing atypical astrocytes are present within the white matter tracts.  No obvious areas of hypercellularity, increased mitotic activity or areas of necrosis are seen.  No vascular proliferation is noted.  The original resection is reviewed (02-39017) and the cytological features are similar in some areas to those of the infiltrating cells. In retrospect, some oligodendroglioma-like areas are identified (see Comment). IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:  Immunohistochemical analysis for Ki-67 was performed on all three biopsies.  The Ki-67 highlights, particularly in the second 'tumor' and 'additional tumor' specimens, scattered atypical astrocytes within the white matter tracts and within the gray matter as well.  In some areas, immunoreactive cells are present surrounding neurons as well as in perivascular locations. COMMENT:  Given the increased number of atypical astrocytes highlighted by Ki-67, and the clinical history of a previous glioblastoma, the findings are suspicious for an infiltrating astrocytoma. Because of the focal oligodendroglial differentiation in the original resection, FISH for 1p and 19q deletional analysis will be performed.

Gating on lymphocytes with low to moderate side and forward-scatter reveals 25% CD45 positive events.  These lymphocytes strongly express CD19, CD20, CD38, and are kappa light chain restricted.  CD10 is not expressed. Gating on monocytes with high forward and side-scatter reveals 6% CD45 positive events.  Appropriately, these monocytes predominately express CD13.  They do not demonstrate aberrant antigen expression or monotypia. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. COMMENTS:  The morphologic features and flow cytometry immunophenotype are consistent with peripheral blood involvement by a low-grade, mature B cell lymphoma. This neoplasm strongly expresses CD19, CD20, CD38, and is kappa light chain restricted. The differential diagnosis includes both CD10 negative follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma, especially splenic marginal zone lymphoma.  Clinical correlation with cytogenetic studies, radiographic imaging to detect enlarged lymph nodes, and physical examination to assess for splenomegaly are recommended to establish a more specific diagnosis.

(Krishnan/Moes/Vogel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name ""Curt, Darrell"" and the medical record number. The specimen is received fresh from the operating room (subsequently placed in formalin), additionally labeled ""brain tumor"", and consists of a 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm fragment of gray-tan, partially necrotic brain tissue.  A touch prep labeled TPA is performed with the above rendered interpretation.  A portion is submitted to the Tissue Bank in the fresh state.  The remaining tissue is further sectioned and representative sections are submitted for permanents labeled A1-A3.   Ruiz for NEUROPATH/cb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis.  They show a hypercellular astrocytic neoplasm that displays moderate nuclear pleomorphism.  The malignant cells are characterized by hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei with moderately dense eosinophilic to focally clear cytoplasm.   Mitotic activity is easily identified.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:      Received from Northern Diagnostic Pathology, Redding, California, are 8 slides labelled S99-298 A-D (4 H&E, 4 immunoperoxidase stained), with a copy of the pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:      Sections from specimens C and D demonstrate fragments of a cellular neoplasm.  The neoplastic cells are disposed in a fibrillar background and have oval to elongated nuclei with granular chromatin, small eosinophilic nucleoli, and scant to moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with elongated cytoplasmic processes.  Occasional mitotic figures are identified.  Focal areas of necrosis, neovascularization and scattered vessels with plump endothelial cells, consistent with vascular proliferation are seen.

The portion of the specimen which is not frozen is placed in tissue paper and submitted entirely in X1.  Schwartz/crh MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the presence of a glial neoplasm and reveal a tumor composed of pleomorphic cells with round to oval nuclei containing fine salt and pepper chromatin.  Numerous thick walled vessels with a surrounding cuff of tumor cells are present are somewhat reminiscent of the pseudopallisades seen in ependymoma. Mitotic figures and endothelial proliferation are readily identified.  Foci suggestive of necrosis are also present. Immunoperoxidase studies:  Immunohistochemical studies show that the tumor cells strongly and diffusely express GFAP and are negative for EMA.

However the permanent sections highlight the neoplasm's dense cellularity, mitotic rate and pleomorphism as well as associated vascular proliferation.  These features as well as the lesion's diffuse expression of GFAP make glioblastoma multiforme the most likely diagnosis.  The nuclear features and vascular cuffing are consistent with some degree of ependymal differentiation.  Based on discussions at the weekly tumor board, the Neuroradiologists also agreed that the location of the tumor from imaging studies would not be typical for an ependymoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:      Received are ten H&E stained slides (nine sections and one smear) from Mills-Peninsula Health Services, labeled PS-98-4401 FS, A-H, with an accompanying pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:      The smear shows numerous irregular, cellular tissue fragments. The tumor cells are moderately enlarged and pleomorphic, with oval to round, occasionally irregular nuclei that have granular to vacuolated chromatin.  Most of the atypical cells have moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with cytoplasmic fibrillar processes.  Some of the atypical cells have small rims and bellies of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Occasional mitotic figures are identified.      The sections show fragments of cortical white and grey matter, variably infiltrated by a an anaplastic glial neoplasm.  The tumor cellularity ranges from scant to heavy, and is best appreciated on the original frozen section.  The tumor is predominantly composed of moderately pleomorphic and enlarged cells with oval to elongated, occasionally irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei.  These cells show scant to moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with fibrillary cytoplasmic processes.  Scattered cells show more round to oval nuclei with finely granular, somewhat cleared chromatin,  small eosinophilic cytoplasmic bellies, and rims of cytoplasm.  Mitotic figures are easily found.  Secondary structures, focal necrosis with pseudopalisading, and vascular proliferation are present. COMMENT: The tumor cellularity is best visualized on the original frozen section and slide ""G.""  The cytologic detail is distorted on the frozen tissue slide and best visualized on the smear.  The tumor cell nuclei demonstrate a tendency to maintain a round to oval contour.  Although the tumor meets the histologic criteria for glioblastoma multiforme, we feel that the histologic features best represent a highly anaplastic oligodendroglioma which borders on glioblastoma multiforme.

We have reviewed the material and agree with the submitted diagnosis. Per report immunohistochemical studies on the outside yielded results consistent with neoplastic expression of Olig2 but not for an IDH1 mutation or ATRX loss. MGMT promoter methylation was not detected. We will summarize our histomorphologic findings below. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The submitted histologic section reveals a hypercellular proliferation of malignant glia notable for nuclear pleomorphism, coarse chromatin, nuclear contour irregularities and variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is easily discerned. Pseudopalisading necrosis is identified, but we do not find convincing microvascular proliferation. CLINICAL HISTORY: Extracting from our electronic medical record, we note that the patient is a 56 year old male who began noticing language difficulties around June.  He eventually sought attention in September after which an MRI was ordered, revealing an enhancing temporal mass. He went to Johns Hopkins for an awake-craniotomy that was done on Sept 30.

Results will be available in Epic. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and confirm the diagnoses rendered intraoperatively. Histologic sections of the right frontal tumor #1 (part A) show a proliferation of meningothelioid cells with vesicular chromatin, nuclear pseudoinclusions, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and mild nuclear pleomorphism and atypia. Some cells show microcystic differentiation while others are adipocytic. Cells are arranged in whorls with occasional psammomatous calcifications. Mitotic figures are not identified. There are no areas of hypercellularity, sheeting architecture, macronucleoli, small cell change, or necrosis. Sections of tumor #2 and #3 (parts B, C, and D) show a proliferation of glial cells with marked nuclear atypia and pleomorphism and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some cells demonstrate a gemistocytoid appearance. Numerous mitotic figures are identified. Several foci of microvascular proliferation and necrosis are identified. Immunohistochemical staining for IDH1 R132H mutation is performed on block B2 and demonstrates no staining within the neoplastic cells, consistent with wild-type status. Immunohistochemical staining for GFAP and a reticulin stain are performed on block B2 to rule out gliosarcoma. The neoplastic cells diffusely express GFAP, confirming glial differentiation. Reticulin staining highlights perivascular architecture with no staining within the neoplasm. Reticulin staining of block D4 sections shows marked reticulin deposition in areas of sarcomatous growth, conforming to gliosarcoma in this portion of the specimen. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old man who presented with left facial droop and personality changes. MRI demonstrates four enhancing right frontal lesions and one left-sided lesion. The largest lesions were associated with edema and midline shift. The two largest lesions were removed for symptomatic relief and diagnosis. A dural-based mass was also removed due to ease of access with the planned approach.

DIAGNOSIS: lymph node, left iliac, ct-guided needle core biopsy (s16-4299; 11/21/2016) --   atypical t-cell proliferation SUSPICIOUS FOR PERIPHERAL T CELL LYMPHOMA with follicular helper t cell phenotype (see comment) MCGINNIS/NATKUNAM/TAN/GRATZINGER TANG COMMENT:  Thank you for allowing us to review this challenging case. We have re-reviewed the previous bone marrow biopsies (SHS-16-52370 and SHS-16-53437), along with the current case. Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic features of these cases are highly suggestive of involvement by a follicular helper T-cell phenotype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (nodal PTCL with TFH phenotype). The concurrent flow cytometry performed on the prior marrow (SHS-16-52370) and the flow cytometry performed on the lymph node biopsy both demonstrate a CD10+ T cell population that co-expresses CD4. This population likely represents the aberrant T cell population that co-expresses follicular helper T cell markers PD-1 and CXCL13 in both the lymph node and bone marrow. It is possible that the patient's positive DAT and recent systemic Zoster infection is a related to immunosuppression/immune dysregulation related to follicular helper T cell lymphoma. Given the scarcity of the lymph node biopsy tissue, minimal lymph node architecture is available for review and molecular studies cannot be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis. Consideration for additional sampling is strongly recommended for definitive diagnosis. Dr. McGinnis communicated the above diagnosis to Dr. Caroline Berube on 11/29/2016 at 2 PM at Dr. Jason Gotlib on 11/30/2016 at 12 PM. Dr. McGinnis communicated the above diagnosis to Dr. Paula Quinn on 11/29/2016 at 4 PM. Drs. Natkunam and Brent Tan have reviewed the current case and agree with the above diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  64-year-old male with a history of GBM s/p resection/chemo/rad without disease recurrence on serial MRI presenting with pancytopenia with positive DAT. Currently being treated with prednisone and rituximab MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic sections demonstrate scant core of tissue composed of a vaguely nodular proliferation of small bland lymphoid cells with an expanded interfollicular region composed small to medium atypical cells. The background of the interfollicular region is composed of numerous eosinophils, rare histiocytes, and a vascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on the provided paraffin embedded block. While only very scant tissue remained following block facing, the remaining tissue demonstrates that the majority of the interfollicular cells are positive for CD3, while CD20 highlights rare nodules of small B cells. PD-1 is expressed diffusely, suggesting co-expression by CD3-positive cells. CD10 is also expressed in the interfollicular regions. CXCL13 has patchy, granular cytoplasmic staining in small lymphoid cells. CD21 is negative with positive external control. CD30 highlights scattered medium-sized immunoblasts, while EBV ISH is negative with positive external control. The proliferation rate as estimated by Ki67 staining is estimated to be approximately 30% in the interfollicular region and is mostly positive in larger cells. S100 and CKMIX stains are negative with positive external control. FLOW CYTOMETRIC IMMUNOPHENOTYPING (per report): Flow cytometry performed on the lymph node biopsy demonstrates a small population of CD10 positive kappa-monotypic B cells (2% of total leukocytes), a small population of kappa-monotypic plasma cells (0.3% of total leukocytes), and a prominent CD4-positive, CD10-positive T cell population with dim CD3, and normal expression of CD2, CD4, CD5, and CD7 without expression of CD1a, CD15, CD30, or CD34 (32% of total leukocytes).

This subtype of follicular lymphoma shares many features with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL).  In fact, it is possible that this lymphoma represents AITL, but because of the limited nature of the specimen, we cannot visualize the typical features of AITL.  In addition, there is a kappa-associated monoclonal plasmacytoid proliferation that is associated with the T-cell lymphoma.  B-cell proliferations have been described in the setting of AITL and PTCL-NOS and likely reflect immune dysregulation (Tan BT, Warnke RA, Arber DA. The Frequency of B- and T-Cell Gene Rearrangements and Epstein-Barr Virus in T-Cell Lymphomas. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics. 2006 Sep;8(4):466Â¿75. Available from: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1525157810603303). Details of the case are provided below.  A stain for CD30 will be ordered and reported as an addendum. The aspirate smears are moderately cellular and show mixed lymphocytes and numerous plasmacytoid cells.  The cell block shows a lymphoid infiltrate composed of clusters of medium sized atypical lymphocytes as well as clusters of plasmacytoid cells.  Immunostains were performed on the cell block, demonstrating that the lymphocytes express CD3 and strong PD-1.  Stains for CD79a and kappa/lambda ISH demonstrate kappa-restricted plasmacytoid cells.  A stain for CD21 highlights rare cells.  An EBV ISH is negative.

AMENDED REPORT: This report is amended to incorporate additional immunohistochemical stains. After reviewing the concurrent lymph node biopsy (SHS-16-54653) with retrospective review of the in-house bone marrow biopsy, we no longer feel that the bone marrow findings are suggestive of a possible myeloproliferative neoplasm. The presence of CD10+ T cells that express dim CD3, bright CD5, and PD1 is highly suggestive for involvement by a peripheral T cell lymphoma with follicular T helper phenotype. In light of this observation, it is very likely that the atypical B cell aggregate described below is associated with this patient's T cell lymphoma. Clinical correlation is recommended.  The diagnosis is changed from ""Atypical paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate suspicious for involvement by B-cell lymphoma"" to ""atypical T cell proliferation suspicious for involvement by T cell lymphoma with associated B cell proliferation"". The changes are italicized below. Dr. McGinnis communicated these results to Dr. Gotlib on 11/30/2016 at 12 PM.

Furthermore, review of the flow cytometry shows the presence of CD10+ CD19 negative likely T-cell population, which likely represent the atypical T cell aggregates observed in the core biopsy. Given the flow cytometric finding and the expression of follicular helper T cell markers CXCL13, CD10, and PD1 on the atypical T cells, we are very suspicious for involvement by a potential T cell lymphoma with follicular helper T cell phenotype (PTCL with FHTC phenotype). These lymphomas are often associated with B cell proliferation, immunosuppression, and hemolytic anemia. Correlation with lymph node biopsy (SHS-16-54653) is recommended. COMMENT:  The bone marrow is hypercellular and fibrotic without overt dysplasia or an increase in blasts.  Left-shifted erythroid precursors are present, and thus the findings do not support pure red cell aplasia currently, although these findings could represent recovery from pure red cell aplasia. Although the PNH study is negative, the results should be interpreted with caution given that the patient is actively undergoing hemolysis.  Parvovirus immunostains and EBV in situ hybridization studies are negative. Correlation with concurrent cytogenetics and molecular studies is recommended. In addition there is an atypical paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate that is composed predominantly of B cells. Morphologic evaluation of this atypical aggregate is limited due to extensive crush artifact but they express HGAL, but not CD5 or BCL1.  Clinical correlation and evaluation for lymphadenopathy is recommended to rule out an occult B cell lymphoproliferative disorder such as follicular lymphoma, which is typically HGAL positive. CLINICAL HISTORY: Red cell aplasia, possibly secondary to dapsone. Patient has positive DAT.

The CD45/SSC plot shows no evidence of an abnormal blast population. A small lymphocyte gate contains predominantly T cells with fewer NK and very few B cells.  B cells show normal expression of B lineage-associated antigens and are too few in number to evaluate for monotypia.  There is a population of lymphocytes that are CD10-positive and CD19-negative. While monocytes were not fully evaluated, they do not express CD56. Granulocytes show a left-shifted maturation pattern of CD13/CD16 expression.

Overall the findings of moderately to significantly increased fibrosis, atypical megakaryocytes, and a hypercellular marrow are concerning for a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Clinical correlation and correlation with molecular analysis for JAK2, CALR, and MPL is recommended. Of note, we do identify left-shifted erythroid precursors both morphologically and via immunohistochemistry. Please note the patient's more recent bone marrow biopsy performed at Stanford (SHS-16-52370).

Â  BONE MARROW ASPIRATE:Â The aspirate smears are aspiculate and hemodilute, showing scattered maturing myeloid precursors and rare erythroid precursors. BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY: The bone marrow is hypercellular for age (90%). Myelopoiesis is hyperplastic and left-shifted with a prominent eosinophilia. Erythroid cells are markedly left-shifted and composed nearly entirely of pronormoblasts. Megakaryocytes are normal to slightly increased in number. Occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes are present with focal loose clusters present. An iron stain shows iron stores are increased without ring sideroblasts. A reticulin stain highlights increased reticulin fibrosis (MF-2 to MF-3). A panel of immunohistochemical stains performed by the referring institution on the core biopsy is reviewed at Stanford. CD20 and Pax-5 highlight rare scattered small B-cells. CD3 is positive in T-cells. CD34 shows no increase in CD34 positive blasts. CD138 highlights scattered plasma cells that are not increased in number. CD42b highlights megakaryocytes. E-cadherin and CD71 are expressed in the left-shifted erythroid precursors.

The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B.   Velasquez for Neuropath/vb MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment.  Sections from both specimens demonstrate similar features, and will be discussed together.  Permanent sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of cells with hyperchromatic, moderately angulated, mildly pleomorphic nuclei.  The tumor is mitotically brisk, with up to 22 mitotic figures / 10 high powered fields identified. Prominent microvascular proliferation is present.  No necrosis is identified. COMMENT:  As the tumor cells are minimally pleomorphic, and focally demonstrate round nuclear contours, the tumor is focally reminiscent of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.  Nonetheless, given the degree of cellularity, pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and vascular pleomorphism we believe this tumor is best classified as glioblastoma.

The lymphocyte gate contains an abnormal B-cell population, accounting for approximately 90% of gated events, which expresses CD5, CD19, dim CD20, dim partial CD22, CD23, and dim surface kappa light chain.  They are negative for CD10 and FMC7.  T- and NK cells account for a minor population of gated events, and show expected reactivity with panel antibodies. A gate on monocytes and other large mononuclear cells contains predominantly CD13+ cells consistent with monocytes, as well as a few larger atypical B-cells with the same phenotype as those seen in the lymphocyte gate.

Velasquez for Neuropath/sf MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  We have reviewed the frozen section slide and agree with the previously rendered diagnosis.  The permanent sections demonstrate a neoplastic process invading predominantly white matter.  The infiltrate is composed of neoplastic astrocytes with hyperchromic, angulated nuclei with a moderate to marked degree of nuclear pleomorphism.  There are readily identifiable mitotic figures and prominent microvascular proliferation, as well as rare small foci of necrosis.  To clarify the nature of the neoplasm, a GFAP immunohistochemical stain and a reticulin stain were performed. A significant proportion of the neoplastic cells demonstrate GFAP immunoreactivity.  Only perivascular reticulin deposition is identified.

We agree with the diagnosis of glioblastoma from outside institutions.  Thank you for the opportunity to review this case in anticipation of patient care at our institution. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of the base of tongue biopsy (S12-3049:3) demonstrate oral squamous mucosa with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.  Histologic sections of the right parietal lobe biopsy (S12-3049:4A-D) demonstrate aspirated fragments of blood clot, brain and fragments of an astrocytic neoplasm with marked cytologic anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains performed at APMG Lab reveal the tumor to be positive for vimentin.  A GFAP immunostain shows a high background reactivity and reactivity in tumor cell processes. CAM5.2, pancytokeratin, CK7, CK20, CD10, HMB45 and Melan-A immunostains are negative in the tumor. EMA and TTF-1 immunostains are reactive in a few neoplastic cells.  Immunostains performed at UCSF are reported as follows: GFAP Â¿ strongly positive; OLIG2 Â¿ patchy positive; neurofilament Â¿ highlights the background neuropil and confirms the infiltrative nature of the neoplasm.

MICROSCOPIC: We agree with the impression of the submitting pathologist. Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. Immunohistochemical studies for IDH1 were performed at UCSF and not reviewed here. Per their addendum report (S12-9682), the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 (R132H mutant) protein. MOLECULAR: This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised.

BRAIN, CUSA CONTENTS, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILDTYPE, GIANT CELL VARIANT, WHO GRADE IV (SEE AMEMDMENT COMMENT) AHMADIAN/KURTZ/CAYROL/VOGEL AMENDEMENT COMMENT:  The molecular profiling results demonstrate the presence of EGFR amplification. Following the recent cIMPACT (consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Taxonomy) recommendations these findings warrant the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of a glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Given the histologic features and the molecular findings the diagnosis is amended to glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, giant cell variant, WHO grade IV. Clinical correlation is required. COMMENT:  In the presence of rare mitosis, lack of necrosis or endothelial cell proliferation and negative IDH1 R132H (wild-type) immunostain, the lesion is best classified as a high-grade astrocytoma with giant cells, IDH1 R132H wild-type.  Overall, the lesion most closely resembles a giant cell glioblastoma but lacks definitive vascular proliferation or necrosis. STAMP and MGMT studies have been ordered and the results will be reported in Epic, respectively, which may conform to molecular features of a glioblastoma WHO grade IV, pending review of the results. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis rendered. The histology sections show diffuse infiltrative glioma with numerous giant cells with markedly irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Scattered mitotic figures are identified. Definitive necrosis and vascular proliferation are not present. Immunostains were performed on block A2 at Stanford Health include IDH1 R132H, ATRX and p53. The neoplastic cells show strong and diffuse p53 positivity (mutated); ATRX is retained (not-mutated) and IDH1 R132H is negative (not-mutated). CLINICAL HISTORY: 56-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism who had a seizure on 8/23/19 secondary to a newly discovered hyperintense mass involving the cortex and subcortical white matter of the right inferior and middle temporal gyri, which is unchanged in extent from 8/24/2019. T2 appearance is most consistent with an infiltrative glioma; however current exam demonstrates apparent new cystic change as well as several foci of enhancement which may present a higher grade component. OPERATION: Right craniotomy for glioma resection CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Glioma ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A2, which contains approximately 60% tumor.

The first specimen labeled ""left temporal mass"" is received fresh and consists of three yellow tan soft tissue fragments measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  Also received in the same container is a 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm aggregate of red tan soft tissue fragments.  A representative portion is submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA) and not exhausted.  The frozen section residue is submitted in A1 and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette A2. The second specimen labeled ""CUSA"" is received fresh and consists of 2.0 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm aggregate of irregular tan-pink soft tissue fragments.  A portion is taken for research by Stanford Tissue Bank and the remainder is submitted in B1. The third specimen labeled ""left temporal mass"" is received fresh and consists of a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm aggregate of tan-yellow to pink soft tissue fragments.  A representative portion is taken for research by Stanford Tissue Bank.  The remainder of the specimen is submitted in C1.   Breitweser for Neuropath/sf One additional container is received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and designated ""left temporal brain mass"". The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 5 x 2.7 cm aggregate of disrupted fragments of brain tissue and spongy, tan-red tissue. Representative sections are submitted in D1 and D2.   Rapuano for Neuropath/jt MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section and agree with the previously rendered diagnosis.  Permanent sections from the four specimens show similar findings and will therefore be described together.  These sections demonstrate a large amount of necrosis with areas of pseudopalisading. The viable areas demonstrate a hypercellular tumor, with a predominantly spindled morphology. In the necrotic areas the tumor cells appear to radiate off of blood vessels. The tumoral cells are pleomorphic, atypical, very mitotically active cells with occasional markedly enlarged nuclei. Multiple areas of vascular proliferation are identified, and frequent thrombi are seen within tumoral vessels.  . To further characterize the tumor, immunohistochemical stains for GFAP and reticulin are performed on block A2.  The tumor cells show uniformly strong GFAP expression, arguing against a diagnosis of gliosarcoma.  The reticulin stain also fails to define a biphasic tumor population.  Taken together, these findings support a diagnosis of glioblastoma with spindled morphology but fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for gliosarcoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received from Lakeland Regional Medical Center in Lakeland, Florida are 21 slides. 5 slides are H&E stained. 6 slides are immunostained with AE 1/3, S-100, CD45, KI67, GFAP, and negative control. 10 slides are unstained. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the slides submitted and agree with the diagnosis rendered by the outside pathologist.  H&E sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei.  Mitotic figures are frequently identified.  Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present. Immunostained slides submitted show these neoplastic cells to be reactive to GFAP, and have a high Ki-67 proliferation index (30-40%). They are non-reactive with CD45 and AE 1/3.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per Epic: 61-year-old woman who 3 weeks previously had undergone partial resection of a left frontal glioblastoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name, Beverly Barnett, and medical record number.  The specimen consists of multiple fragments of unoriented hemorrhagic brain tissue that aggregate to 3.2 x 1.7 x 2.0 cm.  Approximately 60% is kept for tissue bank and given to the Wong Lab.  The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1 and A2.   Weinzierl for Neuropath/sv MICROSCOPIC:  H&E sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. The histological appearance is similar to the concurrently reviewed slides of the recent resection (SHS-09-33410). Mitotic figures are frequently identified.  Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present. Furthermore, there are regions wherein the malignant cells assume a sarcomatoid organization.  Immunohistochemical studies reveal a biphasic pattern of GFAP reactivity. This raises the possibility of a sarcomatoid element. Anti-SMA is non-reactive, providing no evidence for a rhabdoid element.

BRAIN TUMOR (FSA, TPA) B. BRAIN TUMOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is issued to revise the diagnostic lines to reflect the additional data provided by next-generation sequencing. The prior diagnosis of ""GIANT CELL GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV)"" is changed to ""GIANT CELL GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH MUTANT, WHO GRADE 4"". Altered text is present in bold and italics. AMENDMENT COMMENT We reviewed the slides from 2009, and they show markedly pleomorphic glial neoplasm with frequent multinucleated giant cells and microvascular proliferation consistent with the diagnosis of giant cell glioblastoma. The next-generation sequencing result shows IDH R132H mutation and two mutations in the TP53 gene. Giant cell glioblastomas are typically IDH wild-type. However, based on the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, 5% of giant cell glioblastomas can show IDH mutation. The presence of TP53 mutation also is more common in giant cell glioblastoma and supports the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per Epic: This 33-year-old woman was hospitalized approximately 1 week ago after suffering a motor vehicle accident when she apparently had a seizure while driving and crashed her car. At that time her evaluation revealed a left temporal cystic appearing tumor. OPERATION:  Craniotomy for tumor removal.

Flow cytometry also shows a relative increase in cytotoxic T cells (normal CD8 positive expression with CD57 co-expression) with a small subset of dim CD8+ cells with co-expression of CD57.  The dim CD8+ CD57+ population is more often associated with clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements (see reference #1). Overall, these results support a more reactive etiology of LGLs given the absence of cytopenias and increase in other NK and cytotoxic T cell subsets. Increased LGLs can be seen in infectious, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and other reactive conditions, as well as in neoplastic proliferation of LGLs (T-LGL leukemia).  A diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocytic (T-LGL) leukemia requires a persistence of increased LGLs in the peripheral blood for >6 months, usually between 2-20 K/uL (see reference #2).  Clinical correlation and age appropriate cancer screening is recommended.

CD34+ progenitors are not increased, accounting for <1% of total CD45+ events.  The CD45/SSC plot shows no evidence of an abnormal blast population. A small lymphocyte gate contains predominantly T cells with fewer NK and B cells.  B cells show polytypic light chain expression and normal expression of B lineage-associated antigens.  CD8+ T cells show co-expression of CD57 in a reactive pattern. There is also a minor subset of dim CD8+ CD57+ T cells. Normal NK cells (CD3- CD56+ CD16+) account for approximately 15% of lymphocytes. While monocytes were not fully evaluated, they do not express CD56. Granulocytes show an unremarkable pattern of CD13/CD16 expression.

The histologic and immunophenotypic findings in the majority of the current resection tissues are consistent with treatment effects.  The scattered atypical nuclei in parts A and B may represent the effect of radiation on normal tissue or neoplastic glial cells.  The aspirate sample (part E) shows fragments of gray and white matter as well as reactive tissues as seen in A and B and, in a small portion of tissue fragments, moderately cellular areas that suggest an infiltrating glioma lacking the features of glioblastoma.  The significance of this small component of neoplasm is uncertain.  Further clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Inma Cobos viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: We reviewed the frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis. The histologic sections of parts A and B demonstrate cerebral tissue that is slightly hypercellular with reactive appearing small blood vessels.  Ki67 immunohistochemistry on sections from block B1 reveal just rare positive nuclei. The histologic sections of parts C demonstrate dense fibrous tissue with calcifications and foci of chronic inflammation. The histologic sections of part D demonstrate strips of dense fibrous tissue with foci of chronic inflammation and calcification. Foreign material (suture) is noted within the fibrous tissue. The histologic sections of part E demonstrate fragments of gray and white matter with small portions of hypercellular areas composed of cells with hyperchromatic angulated nuclear in a fibrillary background. There is no evidence of microvascular proliferation or tumor necrosis in these areas. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sections from blocks E1 and E2 and show the more cellular areas have increased positive nuclei, estimated 10% proliferation index. CLINICAL HISTORY: Glioblastoma OPERATION: Craniotomy CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent GBM vs. treatment effects ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block E1, which contains approximately 5% neoplastic nuclei.

CDKN2A deletion seen previously could not be positively confirmed in the present resection which is likely related to the impaired copy number analysis related to extremely high-level amplification of EGFR -- nevertheless the deletion appears to be present based on depth. Note that deletions are reported for research use only (RUO) and should be confirmed by another method if clinically actionable. There is no change to the diagnosis of the original report.

The biopsy shows small fragments of gray matter and focal areas of hypercellular white matter.  Unfortunately the areas of hypercellularity are insufficiently sampled to enable classification.  While the hypercellular areas may represent the infiltrating edge of a glioma, we cannot rule out the possibility that these are reactive changes adjacent to a metastatic neoplasm or alternative process.  Clinical and radiographic correlation is required. Dr. Ziskin left a message regarding the case for Dr. Hu on February 20, 2015. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained section demonstrates fragments of gray matter and mild-moderately hypercellular white matter that includes glial cells and macrophages.  Rare mitotic figures are identified and occasional blood vessels show mild perivascular chronic inflammation.  An additional H&E stained slide performed at Stanford and immunohistochemical stains for CD163 and Ki67 show scant residual tissue in the block.    The CD163 stain highlights numerous macrophages. The Ki67 stain is positive in rare scattered nuclei. CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old male with headache, found to have a conspicuous ring-enhancing lesion nearly 3 cm in size in the posterior right temporal lobe with surrounding edema.

The biopsy consists of largely necrotic tissue with reactive changes. However, rare intact fragments show findings characteristic of glioblastoma. A voicemail communicating the diagnosis of glioblastoma was left for Dr. Wilson by Dr. Tan on 3/11/15 at 6pm. Dr. Plowey has also reviewed the case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the brain tumor biopsy show fragments of tissue with extensive necrosis and numerous vascular thrombi. The non-necrotic fragments are hypercellular. A few of these intact fragments comprise an infiltrate of hyperchromatic, pleomorphic cells, associated with microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains were performed at Stanford to better characterize the cells in the intact fragments. The lesional cells are positive for GFAP, CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old man who initially presented with headache and dizziness.

We have reviewed the prior consult (SHS-15-09685) and confirm the diagnosis of ""glioblastoma, WHO grade IV."" The provided histologic sections of the current biopsy and resection show extensive coagulative necrosis and vascular changes consistent with radiation therapy. Focal viable areas show a cellular proliferation of atypical glia with pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei that appear morphologically similar to the malignant cells seen in the prior consult. An immunohistochemical stain for GFAP performed at Stanford on block 1A shows strong and diffuse positivity within these cells, confirming the morphologic impression. Dr. Donald Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the outside report: Frontal right tumor, brain. MRI (6/25/2015): The patient is status post right temporal craniotomy. A rim-enhancing lesion is present in the right temporal lobe, with surrounding white matter edema. The lesion measures approximately 4.4 x 5.7 x 3.8 cm. The lesion has increased in size since previous examination. The thickness of the rim enhancement has also increased. A mild shift of midline structures to the left of approximately 2.5 mm is present.

Also received are a brief clinical vignette and a paraffin block. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections show a tumor that is fairly well delineated from the surrounding brain parenchyma and shows large cystic areas as well.  The tumor background is fibrillary in many areas with areas of marked cellular anaplasia including foci of large bizarre giant tumor cells.  Mitotic activity, some that are aberrant, is readily identified.  In addition, vascular proliferation and small foci of pseudopalisading necrosis are identified. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this case in consultation. The tumor is fairly well demarcated and cystic in several areas, features that can be associated with benign or lower grade CNS neoplasms. However, the features of anaplasia, mitotic activity, vascular proliferation and necrosis support the diagnosis of glioblastoma.

An MRI demonstrated a 3 cm tumor in the area of the pineal gland, with an area suggesting tumor necrosis. The tumor was obstructing the cerebral aqueduct, and caused secondary hydrocephalus. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received in consultation, courtesy of Dr. Ranchod of Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose California, are one H&E stained section, one paraffin-embedded block, and a compact disc containing radiographic images (S08 - 7400B). MICROSCOPIC:  The H&E stained permanent section demonstrates a hypercellular tumor composed of minimally pleomorphic, slightly enlarged hyperchromatic cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and finely granular chromatin. Scattered enlarged, pleomorphic cells are identified.  The tumor is mitotically active, with up to 6 mitotic figures per 10 high powered fields seen. The tumor cells focally demonstrate nuclear molding.  Focal microvascular proliferation and necrosis is also seen.  Numerous vessels also demonstrate intravascular fibrin thrombosis. Given the location and appearance of this tumor, our morphologic differential diagnosis was broad and included pineoblastoma, glioblastoma with a primitive ectodermal tumor-like component, small cell small cell glioblastoma, and an unusual metastasis.  The presence of mitotic activity, necrosis, and endothelial proliferation suggests a grade IV neoplasm.  Several immunohistochemical stains were performed here at Stanford.  The tumor cells are strongly and diffusely positive for GFAP. Synaptophysin demonstrates strong cytoplasmic staining in scattered cells. CKMIX is negative in the tumor cells. P53 demonstrates nuclear staining in approximately 5% of cells overall. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation.  The presence of mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis in a glial tumor (confirmed by GFAP positivity) is consistent with glioblastoma.  The tumor is composed of monotonous cells with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratios and, in some areas, demonstrates nuclear molding.  A subset of the tumor cells also demonstrates strong cytoplasmic synaptophysin positivity. The overall findings are consistent with glioblastoma with a primitive neuroectodermal tumor-like component.  This is not currently recognized as a subcategory of glioblastoma in the 2007 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system. The largest series of such tumors to date suggests that these tumors behave in a similar fashion to typical glioblastomas, with a slight predilection for CSF spread, and that these tumors may respond to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens [1].

A brain MRI on September 26, 2007 demonstrated a 3.8 cm, left superior cerebellar, heterogeneously enhancing mass with a suggestion of a dural tail and involving the left tentorium. The radiologic differential diagnosis included glial tumor versus adult primitive neuroectodermal tumor.  MRI spectroscopy performed on the same date demonstrated findings suggestive of a primary brain tumor.  The patient underwent biopsy on September 26th at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California.  The pathologic diagnosis at that time (case HMS-07-07687) was glioblastoma.  The case was sent to City of Hope National Medical Center, Department of Anatomic Pathology in Duarte, California as a consult (City of Hope case S07-15896) and a diagnosis of ""medulloblastoma, WHO grade IV with focal severe anaplasia"" was rendered. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Thirty-two slides are received courtesy of Dr. Massimo D'Apuzzo of the City of Hope National Medical Center Department of Anatomic Pathology in Duarte, California.  Eleven of the slides are stained with hematoxylin and eosin and sequentially labeled S-7687-07 FS1, TP, and 1 through 9.  The immunohistochemical studies from Huntington Hospital include GFAP, p53, Ki-67, and CAM5.2 performed on block 2.  Stains labeled S07-15896 and performed at City of Hope include a reticulin stain on block 5 and immunohistochemical stains for synaptophysin, Neu-N, neurofilament, chromogranin and EMA on block 2 and synaptophysin and GFAP on block 5, and a negative control.  Four unstained slides each corresponding to blocks 2 and 5 are also received. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The sections show infiltration of the cerebellum by a neoplasm composed predominantly of cells with small round-to-ovoid nuclei, stippled chromatin, and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Occasional nuclear enlargement is seen.  In multiple foci, the tumor cells show a prominent perivascular arrangement.  A nested growth pattern is also seen focally.  Multiple areas of microvascular proliferation and a rare focus of pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  In some areas the tumor cells are densely packed and show frequent mitoses.  A reticulin stain highlights intratumoral vessels. Immunohistochemistry:  The outside immunohistochemical stains show weak-to-strong diffuse cytoplasmic GFAP immunopositivity and moderate-to-strong diffuse synaptophysin positivity in the tumor cells.  Rare, scattered cells (less than 5% of the tumor cells) show p53 immunopositivity.  A NeuN stain highlights disordered band-like areas of positivity, compatible with non-neoplastic granular cell neurons infiltrated by tumor.  A rare cell shows cytoplasmic chromogranin and EMA reactivity.  Neurofilament and CAM5.2 stains are negative.  There is a Ki-67 labeling index of up to 50% in the most proliferative areas. COMMENT:   Our differential diagnosis includes glioblastoma with medulloblastoma-like features and medulloblastoma with glial differentiation.  Based on the patient's age and the presence of vascular proliferation, we favor a diagnosis of glioblastoma.  Thank you for sending this challenging case in consultation.

Specimen A labeled  brain tumor  is received fresh from the OR.  It consists of multiple, irregular tan tissue fragments that measure 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate.  Representative samples of the specimen are submitted as frozen section A and squash prep A analysis.   The remainder of the frozen tissue is entirely submitted as FSA.  The rest of the unfrozen specimen is entirely submitted as A. Specimen B labeled  brain tumor  is received in formalin.  It consists of multiple fragments of tan-red tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate and is entirely submitted as B. Specimen C labeled  CUSA elements  is received in formalin.  It consists of a 20.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 bag with multiple tan soft tissue fragments that measure 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 in aggregate.  The entire specimen is submitted as C1-C2.  Kwong/mv MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The permanent sections confirm the intra-operative frozen section diagnosis.  They show neoplastic astrocytes with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei infiltrating the granular and molecular layer of the cerebellum.  Mitotic figures, foci of necrosis, and microvascular proliferation are evident amidst reactive astrocytes. Also, in the areas of necrosis, large proliferative vessels are seen, some of which demonstrate intravascular thrombosis.  A rare vessel is seen with calcification of its wall, possibly consistent with prior radiation therapy effect. COMMENT: The patient's previous biopsy of purported ependymoma is not available for concurrent review. The present tumor is most consistent with glioblastoma multiforme. The possibility that this may represent a remote radiation tumor is entertained.

His history is also remarkable for a lung mass. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received, courtesy of Dr. Christie L. Elliot, from Renown Health in Reno, Nevada are 11 slides labeled SU07-04602. Four of the slides are stained with H&E and additionally labeled CFS1, C1, DFS1 and D1.  The remaining slides consist of immunohistochemical stains for GFAP, AE1:3, HMB45 and Melan-A along with 2 negative control slides and a positive control slide for GFAP.  The outside pathology report is also included. MICROSCOPIC:  The sections show a moderately cellular neoplasm within the brain tissue.  The neoplastic cells have enlarged, angulated nuclei and a moderate amount of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.  A few scattered bizarre, pleomorphic cells are present. Many of the cells have fibrillar processes while, focally, others have more well-defined cell-borders.  Numerous mitotic figures are scattered throughout the lesion.  There is patchy lymphocytic inflammation scattered throughout the neoplasm, some of which is arranged in a perivascular pattern.  Vascular proliferation and necrosis are identified.  An immunohistochemical stain for GFAP is positive in the neoplastic cells.  AE1/AE3 shows patchy positivity in the neoplastic cells.  Stains for HMB45 and Melan-A are negative in the neoplastic cells. COMMENT:  Clinical history received from the consulting pathologist indicated that this patient has a lung lesion which may be a calcified granuloma.  If there is a possibility that the lung lesion represents a malignancy, then clinical and radiologic correlation are strongly recommended.  The morphologic features seen in the current specimen are consistent with glioblastoma, and a GFAP-positive metastatic carcinoma from the lung would be unusual.

Although the specimen shows extensive necrosis, the neoplastic cells and associated features seen in the frozen sections and, to a lesser extent, in the fixed tissue are convincing for glioblastoma.  At the clinicians request MGMT promoter methylation analysis can be performed although due to extensive necrosis the quantity of viable cells may be insufficient to complete the test.  Further clinical correlation is suggested. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Donald Born communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Joseph Chen on 11/09/2018. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E sections reveal fragments of necrotic tissue with rare foci of atypical glial cells.  The nuclei are moderately pleomorphic with nuclear irregularities and hyperchromasia.  The frozen section has more viable tissue where, in addition to atypical glial cells there is a mitotic figure and microvascular proliferation.

MICROSCOPIC:  The H&E sections show a largely necrotic tumor with perivascular nests of large cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and vacuolated cytoplasm.

The provided synaptophysin stain is equivocal. Our repeat synaptophysin appears negative. The provided GFAP is equivocal. Our repeat GFAP shows some staining of lesional cells but is also somewhat equivocal. EGFR is negative. Given that some of the tumor is focally GFAP positive and negative for keratins, we favor a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended.

Dr. Peyman Samghabadi communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Anand Kunda on 9/11/15. MICROSCOPIC: The provided histologic sections of the right occipital biopsies reveal an infiltrating neoplasm that reaches high cellularity composed of glial cells notable for enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, coarse chromatin, variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity.  Necrosis associated with mixed inflammation is present.  Microvascular proliferation is seen.  The fixed tissue of the frozen section remnants and squash preparations from specimen A reveal mild cytologic atypia, but do not have the neoplastic glial infiltrate.  The provided immunohistochemistry for GFAP highlights both reactive astrocytes and neoplastic cells.  Provided histologic special stains (AFB and GMS) reveal no evidence of acid fast bacilli or fungi. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Per the submitted documents MRI showed a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm irregular enhancing mass in the mesial right occipital lobe with surrounding edema and extension across the splenium of the corpus callosum.  This is suspicious for a glioblastoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Case 02-SP-15-0037233 (22 slides, 1 CD) was received in consultation from Dr. Anand S.

CALVARIUM, RIGHT FRONTAL, RESECTION --   MOST CONSISTENT WITH UNDIFFERENTIATED PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA (SEE COMMENT) PARK/CAYROL/AHMADIAN/VAN DE RIJN/VOGEL COMMENT:  We have reviewed the slides from the recent fine needle aspiration specimen (SHS-19-2910) which demonstrates similarly appearing malignant cells as seen in this current resection.  We note the extensive immunohistochemical studies performed on the recent FNA specimen which revealed no evidence for an astrocytic, meningothelial, epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, neuroectodermal, melanocytic, or hematolymphoid differentiation.  We performed additional immunostains on this current resection specimen which demonstrates some expression for histiocytic markers within the malignant cells.  Given the largely negative immunophenotypic expression, the findings are most consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, a diagnosis largely of exclusion. Of note, we reviewed the initial brain biopsy (SHS-11-32572) and agree with the diagnosis rendered at the time demonstrating glioblastoma WHO grade IV.  This current specimen is morphologically very different from that of his glioblastoma.  Given the interesting presentation and complexity of this tumor, we have sent unstained slides to Foundation One to garner possible underlying molecular signatures in the tumor. Dr.  Matt van de Rijn (soft tissue pathology) has reviewed the slides and concurs. MICROSCOPIC:  The histologic sections demonstrate a cellular proliferation of spindled malignant cells characterized by markedly pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, multinucleation, and variable amounts of delicate cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are readily identified.  The malignant cells are negative for mixed cytokeratin (AE1/Cam5.2), S100, and BRAF (V600E).  A CD68 (histiocytic) stain is positive in many of the malignant cells as well as the intervening histiocytes.  A CD163 (histiocytic) stain is positive in a subset of the malignant cells and is also positive in the intervening histiocytes.  A p53 stain is largely negative (negative staining).

The ultrasound guided FNA was performed by Dr. Eric Yang. There was minimal (<5 mL) blood loss and no complications; the patient tolerated the procedure well. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Rec'd 3 air dried, 1 fixed smears and material for cell block; # of passes 3, gauge of needle 23G, size of lesion 2cmx1cm. CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT SCALP MASS, ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION --   PLEOMORPHIC MALIGNANt neoplasm (SEE COMMENT) ADAMS/ALLARD/AHMADIAN/BORN/HOWITT/E. YANG DIAGNOSTIC COMMENTS:  The aspirate smears are moderately cellular and show malignant cells characterized by markedly pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei, occasional multinucleation, nuclear inclusions, and variable amounts of delicate cytoplasm. The cell block sections show concordant features, with occasional mitotic figures noted. Immunohistochemical stains show that the malignant cells are negative for GFAP, CAM5.2, 34betaE12, p63, EMA, CD34, ERG, desmin, smooth muscle actin, S100, SOX-10, HMB45, Melan-A, CD30, CD45, ALK, and MDM2. INI1 demonstrates retained nuclear labeling. Overall, the immunostains do not provide specific support for astrocytic, meningothelial, epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, neuroectodermal, melanocytic, or hematolymphoid differentiation. We have reviewed the patient's prior excisional biopsy of glioblastoma (SHS-11-32572) and note that the tumors are not morphologically similar; the current tumor exhibits much more significant cytotologic atypia than the original tumor. As the patient received radiation therapy for treatment of glioblastoma, it is possible that this current tumor represents a radiation-associated malignancy; however, the possibility of a late recurrence is not entirely excluded. Clinical and radiographic correlation is needed. Drs. Donald Born (neuropathology) and Brooke Howitt (bone and soft tissue pathology) have reviewed this case and concur. ANCILLARY STUDIES:  Ancillary studies have been performed on block A1, which contains approximately 80% tumor. IMMEDIATE EVALUATION:  Immediate evaluation for adequacy using representative Diff-Quik stained slides was performed by Dr. Eric Yang. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. ERIC YANG M.D., Ph.D.   Electronically signed 11/12/2019 9:26 PM   ACCESSION NUMBER: SHF-19-02910"

MOLECULAR COMMENT: Interpretation: This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.Â  MICROSCOPIC:  We fully agree with the submitting pathologist's assessment.  Sections of the tumor demonstrate a glial neoplasm composed of atypical cells with nuclear pleomorphism, irregular nuclear contours, and variably hyperchromatic, coarse chromatin. Many cells have a gemistocytic appearance; these cells normally express INI-1 by immunohistochemistry.  Frequent mitotic figures are seen, and extensive vascular proliferation is present. Immunohistochemistry for IDH-1 shows that the tumor cells are strongly positive.  We have not received the slides for review, but by report GFAP highlights reactive and neoplastic glial cells, Ki-67 shows foci of brisk proliferation, and many nuclei are p53 positive. Overall, the findings are consistent with glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).

We agree with your impression of a glioblastoma. The features of endovascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis support this diagnosis. While pleomorphic xanthroastrocytoma (PXA) is certainly in the differential diagnosis, we feel that there are no classic features of PXA present, including no definite eosinophilic granular bodies. Several tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm are identified, raising the possibility of a rhabdoid glioblastoma; an INI-1 immunohistochemical stain may be considered to help determine whether a rhabdoid component is present. The diagnosis of glioblastoma was discussed with Dr. Olson at 4:30PM on 8/30/12 by Dr. Vogel. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the right temporal brain show an abundantly cellular glial neoplasm characterized by enlarged cells showing pleomorphism. In some areas, mitotic figures are frequent. Large areas of pseudopalisading necrosis are identified, in addition to endovascular proliferation. Included immunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be positive for GFAP and S100. A MIB-I (Ki-67) stain shows a proliferation rate of >50%. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the provided report, this is a 48 year old man presenting with generalized seizure. Imaging showed a 1.9 cm peripherally enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe.

We agree with your diagnostic impression of glioblastoma.  The neoplasm has features of ependymoma that appear to be part of a spectrum of glial differentiation where there is also extensive infiltration and abundant necrosis (focally with pseudopalisading) to support the diagnosis of glioblastoma. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show an infiltrative proliferation of neoplastic cells with variable features and forming a variety of arrangements. In general the cells have hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular angulated nuclear contours, coarse chromatin and quite pleomorphic cytoplasm. There are areas where there are poor cellular borders while in other areas there are quite distinctive cytoplasmic processes.  In a number of areas cells are arranged in a pseudorosette associated with blood vessels and a subset of these have a nearly papillary appearance.  Mitotic figures are readily identified.  Microvascular proliferation and abundant necrosis is seen throughout the sections. Provided immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the neoplastic cells are positive for p53 overexpression, and there is focal dot like immunoreactivity for EMA. The background astrocytes are strongly immunoreactive to GFAP and WT-1 and the background axons are reactive to neurofilament. This tumor is negative for the R132H IDH1 mutation and Ki-67 stains 10% of the tumor cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  According to the submitted radiology report, this is a 52 year old female with a peripheral irregular enhancing lesion measuring approximately 3.9 x 2.9 cm within the posterior high right frontal lobe with surrounding T2 bright brain parenchymal signal changes. There are surrounding vascular flow voids adjacent to the lesion.

MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections from specimen A contains a malignant proliferation of atypical glial cells with increased nuclear size and irregular nuclear contours that is infiltrative of the adjacent brain parenchyma. There are foci suggestive of microvascular proliferations and adjacent necrosis. Collectively, the features are consistent with residual/recurrent glioblastoma. Specimen B contains cortex parenchyma with areas of atypical glial nuclei that are suggestive of an infiltrating glioma. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the Pathology Tissue Exam Request: 78-year-old male with history of brain tumor, glioblastoma multiforme In the electronic medical record, Epic, we find Hsien Liu has history of a right frontal glioblastoma, IDH wild-type, MGMT un-methylated, status post resection on 11/24/20.  He subsequently underwent definitive chemoradiation with concurrent TMZ, completed on 02/09/2021.  He has felt increased tremors in his left hand with overall weakness noticed in his left upper extremity.  Recent MRI revealed increased contrasting enhancing disease at the resection bed.  Plan is for tumor debulking and placement of Gliadel wafers in the resection bed. OPERATION: Right redo craniotomy for resection of tumor with possible placement of gliadel wafer ANCILLARY STUDIES: If ancillary studies are indicated they may be performed on block A2, which contains approximately 15% tumor.

The presence of IDH1 and ATRX mutations is associated with secondary glioblastoma and predicts a better prognosis.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are underway and results will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.  MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of specimens A, D and E demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant appearing population of cells characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity and globular to fibrillar cytoplasm associated with many of the nuclei.  There are numerous giant, bizarre nuclei and scattered atypical mitotic figures.  Also seen is prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.  Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block A2 reveals the following for the neoplastic cells: IDH-1 R132H mutation is positive; ATRX is absent from nuclei (positive internal control). CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the Pathology Tissue Examination Request: Meningioma.  Extracting from the electronic medical record and discussion at intraoperative consultation we find Colleen Cody is a 45-year-old female who presented with blurred vision and visual field deficit on the right side, starting approximately 2-3 months ago. Examination revealed a right-sided hemianopsia and right afferent pupillary deficit. An MRI demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing 3 cm left posterior-medial temporal mass, thought consistent with meningioma. Findings during resection were thought consistent with glioma.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:  C1 and C2 - largest nodule; C3 - smaller colloid nodule; C5 - small tan nodule. Rapuano for Cuff/mc COMMENT:  Sections from the total thyroidectomy demonstrate a multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma. There are two foci of carcinoma in the left lobe the largest measuring 2.6 cm and an additional 1.4 cm focus within the isthmus. The larger two nodules show features of classic papillary thyroid carcinoma and are partially encapsulated with multifocal areas of capsular invasion and extension into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue. The smaller nodule within the left lobe demonstrates features of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma.  The tumor is present at the black inked margin of resection of the left thyroid lobe (B1). There is one lymph node identified which shows metastatic carcinoma. There are also two fragments of parathyroid tissue identified accompanying the left lobe specimen. The remainder of the thyroid parenchyma shows adenomatous hyperplasia and chronic thyroiditis.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FS1: BRAIN, BIOPSY --   GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (Hattab/Schwartz/Horoupian) GROSS DESCRIPTION: The first specimen labeled ""brain tumor"" is received fresh from the operating room and consists of multiple fragments of tan to red tissue which measure 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.  A portion of the specimen is frozen and used for FS1.  The tissue remaining after the frozen section is placed in tissue paper and submitted entirely in FS1.  The portion of the specimen which is not frozen is submitted entirely in X1. The second specimen labeled ""brain tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple fragments of light tan to dark brown brain parenchyma which measure 4.9 x 4.5 x 1.8 cm in aggregate. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in A1 through A3.   Schwartz/jg MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme and reveal a tumor composed of densely packed markedly pleomorphic cells associated with endothelial proliferation, numerous crisscrossing thin-walled vessels and pseudopalisading necrosis. Vascular thrombi and deposits of hemosiderin pigment indicative of prior hemorrhage are seen. Mitotic figures are readily identified.  In areas the cell nuclei are round or oval with smooth contours while in other areas they are predominantly angular or large and multilobated.  A gliofibrillary component is also present. Immunoperoxidase studies:     Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate some fields of tumor cells to diffusely express GFAP. The gliofibrillary tumor cells display GFAP positive ""bellies"" and blunt processes. The proliferation marker MIB-1 labels 30% of the tumor cells.

It is possible that current tumor arose from an oligodendroglioma. I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

OPERATION: Craniotomy with resection of tumor with Gliadel wafer placement. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Not given. GROSS DESCRIPTION:      The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ""glioblastoma left frontal temporal"" and consists of multiple fragments of brain tissue and dura.  The brain tissue has an aggregate measurement of 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm.  The two pieces of light tan dura measure approximately 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm.  The brain tissue is light tan in color with grossly unremarkable gyri and sulci as well as gray-white demarcation patterns.  The largest fragment of brain tissue has measurements of 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  Serial sectioning of the larger fragment demonstrates a central area of hemorrhage and necrosis that measures 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.  Representative sections of the brain tissue are submitted in cassettes labeled A1-A5, and representative sections of the dura are submitted in cassette labeled A6. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections demonstrate fragments of tumor and brain tissue.  In the less cellular areas the tumor diffusely infiltrates the cortical ribbon and underlying white matter.  Focal perineuronal satellitosis is seen within the tumor infiltrated cortical ribbon.  In most areas the tumor is vascular and markedly cellular, with focal areas of necrosis.  In these areas the tumor cells are arranged in a solid, back to back fashion, as well as in cellular nests surrounded by a network of gliotic less cellular tumor.  In many areas the tumor cells are arranged in a radial perivascular pattern with a fibrillar to fibrotic nuclear free zone immediately adjacent to the vessel, very suggestive of ependymal pseudorosettes.  In some areas the tumor cells show marked nuclear pleomorphism with frequently bizarre multinucleate giant tumor cells  In other areas they are more monomorphic with round hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse granular chromatin, inconspicuous to small nucleoli, and insignificant to small amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  In focal areas the tumor cells demonstrate a gemistocytic appearance.  Mitotic figures are numerous.  Focal vascular proliferation is identified. Immunoperoxidase stains:  In patchy areas the tumor cells show positive cytoplasmic staining for GFAP.  Many of the perivascular pseudorosettes-like structures show strong staining of the cytoplasmic processes within the perivascular nuclear free zone. Synaptophysin highlights areas of infiltrated/residual neuropil, but does not stain tumor cells. DIAGNOSIS: BRAIN, TUMOR, BIOPSY --GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME WITH FOCAL EPENDYMAL FEATURES, SEE COMMENT X20-94403 CRUZ/ATKINS/WILSON/HOROUPIAN ck/01/15/9 COMMENT:      The morphologic and immunohistochemical features in the current specimen are consistent with glioblastoma multiforme.  While in many areas the tumor has astrocytic features, the scattered perivascular pseudorosette-like structures are very suggestive of ependymal differentiation.  The latter finding is sometimes seen in glioblastomas.      Representative sections from the patient's previous material (SHS-95-11406/NP6604) are reviewed concurrently and are essentially similar.

The first part is received in formalin and consists of multiple fragments of white-brown soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 0.7 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A3. The second part is a CUSA specimen received in saline.  It consists of multiple fragments of red-white soft tissue measuring in aggregate 40 ml.  Representative sections are submitted in B1 and B2. MICROSCOPIC:   Sections from the specimen show fragments of tumor and brain parenchyma.  In the subpial areas, the neoplastic cells are extremely hypercellular with marked nuclear pleomorphism and multinucleate giant tumor cells.  Mitotic figures are frequently seen, and there is focal necrosis and endothelial cell proliferation.  In other areas, the tumor is less cellular, and focal perineuronal satellitosis is seen.  Focally in some areas, the neoplastic cells appear more monomorphic with round nuclei, suggestive of oligodendroglioma.

The results are taken verbatim from the cytogenetics report (#023060), which reads as follows: KARYOTYPE: 39~41, XX,-4,del(5)(p13p15),-6,+7,del(9)(p11),-10,-11,-12,-13,-17,-21,-22,~ 1~2dmin[cp4] 46,XX[3] REPORT: A tumor biopsy was received, mechanically disaggregated and established in short-term culture.  Cultures were harvested, and chromosomes were analyzed by the GTW method. Seven analyzable metaphases were observed from three and four day cultures, four of which were grossly abnormal with chromosome counts of 39 to 41.  These four cells were characterized by loss of chromosomes #4, 6, 10, 11,12, 13, 17, 21, 22 and an extra copy of chromosome #7.  In addition, these cells also had a deletion in the short arm of a chromosome #5 and a deletion in the short arm of a chromosome #9.  Because of the observed heterogeneity, these cells have been described above by the ISCN 1995 as a composite karyotype listing all clonal abnormalities. Three cells appeared to have normal chromosomes, including one cell with apparently random chromosome loss. The presence of this abnormal clone is significant and indicative of a neoplastic process.  More specifically, gain of chromosome #7, deletion of the short arm of chromosome #9 and loss of chromosome #10 have frequently been described in the literature of glioblastoma multiforme and are consistent with this diagnosis.  Loss of the short arm of chromosome #1 and the long arm of chromosome #19 were not observed. COMMENT:  The original diagnoses remain unchanged.

BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL LOBE, RESECTION (SU20-11945; 12/09/2020) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE 4, NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED TOLAND/AHMADIAN/VOGEL COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation. We agree with your diagnostic impression of glioblastoma. The histologic features are compatible with the small cell variant. Small cell glioblastomas often demonstrate EGFR amplifications, though the prognosis is not significantly different from typical glioblastomas. Given the patient's age, an IDH mutation is not likely and is not tested in this case. If MGMT promoter methylation analysis is desired, testing can be performed and reported as an addendum. Dr. Cobos has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show a hypercellular proliferation of moderately atypical glial cells infiltrating brain parenchyma. Scattered mitotic figures are present. Multiple foci of microvascular proliferation are identified. No necrosis is present. The provided immunohistochemical stain for GFAP shows strong diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells and highlights background reactive astrocytes. The stain for CD30 highlights background brain parenchyma and is negative in the neoplastic cells. The stain for Ki-67 highlights many of the neoplastic cells, focally reaching a proliferative index of ~70%. The stain for CK mix highlights occasional reactive astrocytes. The stains for BCL1, BCL2, and BCL6 show scattered expression in the neoplastic cells. The stains for CD3, CD5, CD20, and PAX5 highlight scattered mixed lymphocytes. The stains for CD10, CD21, and CD23 are negative. CLINICAL HISTORY:  77-year-old woman with a left parietal nodular enhancing mass.

HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 12/5/2011 5:09 PM ***ADDENDUM*** An addendum is issued to this report to permit comment on the results of MGMT promoter methylation analysis. The original diagnosis remains unchanged. The text of the molecular report is reproduced in the addendum comment: COMMENT (ADDENDUM): Result: Positive Comment: Positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Interpretation: This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.

Dobo for neuropath/jt MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The intraoperative consultation slides are reviewed and we agree with the diagnosis as stated above. The permanent sections of the first specimen reveal predominantly necrotic (approximately 80%) tissue adjacent to a glial neoplasm composed of modestly pleomorphic astrocytic cells.  Mitotic figures are easily found.  A focal edge of pseudopalisading is evident in one region.  While there appears to be a proliferation of vessels in one area, there is also substantial cautery artifact. The section specimen consists of fragments of cortex and white matter infiltrated by an extensively necrotic glial neoplasm composed of astrocytic cells with a moderate degree of nuclear pleomorphism and varying amounts of cytoplasm.  Mitotic figures are readily identified.  There is exuberant vascular proliferation. Many areas of pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  There are sclerotic margins associated with many of the included larger caliber vessels.

This case was discussed with Dr. Lorelle Carlley by phone on November 26, 2012 at 4:45 PM. MICROSCOPIC: Thank you for sending this challenging case in consultation.  We agree with your impression of a primary glial neoplasm.  Histologic sections demonstrate an astrocytic neoplasm with cytologic anaplasia but relatively low cellularity and abundant ropy fibrillar processes.  In some areas, the astrocytic processes mimic Rosenthal fibers, however, true Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies are not seen.  Several mitotic figures are identified with very careful inspection.  There is abundant microvascular proliferation and focal pseudopalisading necrosis is seen at the very edge of one of the tissue fragments.  A neurofilament immunostain was employed to confirm the diffuse, infiltrative nature of this neoplasm in the absence of obvious entrapped brain parenchyma on the H&E stained sections.  A Ki67 immunostain is difficult to interpret with the low tumor cellularity and prominent microvascular proliferation, but is estimated at 10-12%.  A reticulin stain shows no significant pericellular reticulin as would be expected in gliosarcoma or PXA. CLINICAL HISTORY: The 64-year-old male with an enhancing mass in the left inferior frontal lobe.  Six slides and one block are received from Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley, California.

COMMENT: Molecular testing for MGMT promoter methylation and Solid Tumor Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP) has been initiated and will be reported in EPIC and as an addendum. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and we agree with the intraoperative diagnoses. The histologic sections of specimens A-C and F reveal hypercellular cortical tissue with infiltrating atypical glial cells. There is no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. Histologic sections of specimens D and G reveal a glial proliferation of atypical cells with nuclear pleomorphism, microvascular proliferation, pseudo-palisading necrosis and increased mitotic activity. The cells show elongated cytoplasmic processes with variably eosinophilic and basophilic vesicular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry for IDH1 (R132H) was performed on block A2 and is negative. Immunohistochemistry against p53 shows only rare scattered nuclei and ATRX expression is seen in all the cells (conserved).

Gating on lymphocytes (strong CD45+, low FSC/SCC) shows a heterogeneous population of lymphoid cells with a predominance of T-cells and smaller numbers of B-cells and NK-cells. There is no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or abnormal T-cell population. No aberrant antigen expression is detected among lymphoid cells.   The monocyte/large lymphocyte gate (CD45+, moderate SSC/FSC) shows predominantly CD4+ cells with negative to dim CD13, which may represent histiocytes with down regulated CD13. A gate on CD45 negative events shows that most express CD56, but show scatter properties consistent with either non-intact cells or debris.  As no malignant or highly atypical cells are noted on our touch preparations, this finding is of uncertain significance and may not be diagnostically contributory.  Correlation with other morphologic preparations is necessary. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. COMMENT:  The evaluation of the first specimen in ongoing.  This report is being issued prior to completion of that review, at the request of the clinicians, to permit the institution of therapy.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The sections of the first specimen demonstrate dense connective tissue containing aggregates of small lymphocytes and surfaced by a collection of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm.  There is nuclear molding. The chromatin is stippled and nucleoli are not readily identified. No mitotic figures or foci of necrosis are seen.  To attempt to characterize the nature of the cells, immunohistochemical stains for CD45, GFAP, EMA, Ki-67, chromogranin, S100 protein, CD99 and pankeratin are performed.  The atypical cells show no immunoreactivity for CD45 (with immunoreactivity in the small lymphocytes), GFAP, EMA, chromogranin, S100 protein, CD99 or pankeratin.  There is a small aggregate of meningothelial cells, distinct from the atypical cells, which is EMA immunoreactive.  The Ki-67 labeling index approaches 5% in the most proliferative area. A GFAP immunostain is also subsequently performed on block C9 of the third specimen in which a focus of smaller cells with a similar phenotype as those seen in the first specimen are found.  While there is diffuse GFAP immunoreactivity in much of the neoplasm in this block, there is only rare immunoreactivity in the focus with a small cell phenotype. The diagnosis of the first specimen has been altered to reflect the results of the immunostains above. COMMENT:  The atypical cells in the first specimen share cytomorphologic features with a rare focus in the main resection specimen.  These foci may represent more primitive or dedifferentiated areas within an otherwise typical appearing glioblastoma.  This case was presented at the Stanford neuropathology interesting case conference on August 7, 2006.

The first specimen is received fresh from the operating room, stated to be ""left temporal tumor"" and consists of two pieces of soft tissue measuring 0.4 and 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative portions are used for squash preparation and frozen section as TPA and FSA, respectively.  The frozen tissue is not exhausted and submitted entirely in cassette FSA.  The non-frozen portion of the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette A1. The second specimen is received fresh from the operating room, stated to be ""left temporal brain tumor"" and consists of a soft tissue fragment measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.4 cm.  Representative portions are used for squash preparation and frozen section as TPB and FSB, respectively.  The frozen tissue is not exhausted and submitted entirely in cassette FSB.  The non-frozen portion of the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette B1, except for a portion further submitted for flow cytometry. The third specimen is received fresh from the operating room, stated to be ""left temporal tumor"" and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan tissue measuring 6 x 6.5 x 1 cm.  One-half of the specimen is submitted for tissue banking.  The remainder of the tissue is submitted entirely in cassettes C1-C11.   Dobo for Neuropath/vb MICROSCOPIC:  The permanent sections confirm the intraoperative squash preparation and frozen section diagnoses for both specimens. Sections from the second and third specimens show a glial neoplasm within a fibrillar background.  The nuclei range in size from small and angulated to large, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic.  Brisk mitotic activity is present, up to 15 mitoses per 10 high power fields.  Pseudopalisading necrosis and vascular proliferation are also present.  Scattered foci of dense lymphoid infiltrates are also seen.

Gating on lymphocytes (strong CD45+, low FSC/SCC) shows a heterogeneous population of lymphoid cells with a predominance of T-cells and smaller numbers of B-cells and NK-cells. There is no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or abnormal T-cell population. No aberrant antigen expression is detected among lymphoid cells.   The monocyte/large lymphocyte gate (CD45+, moderate SSC/FSC) shows predominantly CD4+ cells with negative to dim CD13, which may represent histiocytes with down regulated CD13. A gate on CD45 negative events shows that most express CD56, but show scatter properties consistent with either non-intact cells or debris.  As no malignant or highly atypical cells are noted on our touch preparations, this finding is of uncertain significance and may not be diagnostically contributory.  Correlation with other morphologic preparations is necessary. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The sections of the first specimen demonstrate dense connective tissue containing aggregates of small lymphocytes and surfaced by a collection of atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm.  There is nuclear molding. The chromatin is stippled and nucleoli are not readily identified. No mitotic figures or foci of necrosis are seen.  To attempt to characterize the nature of the cells, immunohistochemical stains for CD45, GFAP, EMA, Ki-67, chromogranin, S100 protein, CD99 and pankeratin are performed.  The atypical cells show no immunoreactivity for CD45 (with immunoreactivity in the small lymphocytes), GFAP, EMA, chromogranin, S100 protein, CD99 or pankeratin.  There is a small aggregate of meningothelial cells, distinct from the atypical cells, which is EMA immunoreactive.  The Ki-67 labeling index approaches 5% in the most proliferative area. A GFAP immunostain is also subsequently performed on block C9 of the third specimen in which a focus of smaller cells with a similar phenotype as those seen in the first specimen are found.  While there is diffuse GFAP immunoreactivity in much of the neoplasm in this block, there is only rare immunoreactivity in the focus with a small cell phenotype. The diagnosis of the first specimen has been altered to reflect the results of the immunostains above. COMMENT:  The atypical cells in the first specimen share cytomorphologic features with a rare focus in the main resection specimen.  These foci may represent more primitive or dedifferentiated areas within an otherwise typical appearing glioblastoma.

MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of the brain tumor excision specimen demonstrate a cellular glial neoplasm with two distinct morphologic phenotypes.  A portion of the tumor is composed of glial cells with large, somewhat spindled, high grade nuclei with numerous mitotic figures.  This portion of the neoplasm is relatively well-circumscribed.  The other part of the tumor is made up of lipidized glial cells with round to oval nuclei and variably prominent nucleoli.  Mitotic figures are identified in both components, though they are less prominent than in the higher grade area.  This pattern of increase proliferation is confirmed by the Ki-67 stain, which shows similar findings.  GFAP is present in the lipidized cells and negative in the high grade-appearing area.  The tumor is negative for IDH-1.  CD163 highlights scattered macrophages.  Molecular studies for MGMT methylation and BRAF mutational analysis have been initiated and will be reported in Epic. CLINICAL HISTORY: None provided OPERATION: Left temporal craniotomy with tumor resection CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

MGMT promoter methylation testing is in progress and the results will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of each specimen demonstrate an infiltrative, highly cellular, glial proliferation with sheet-like and vaguely nodular architecture. The neoplastic cells are characterized by pleomorphic but somewhat monotonous features, hyperchromatic nuclei, dense coarse chromatin and scant cytoplasm that produces few cytoplasmic borders. The nuclei are seen on a somewhat vesicular, occasionally fibrillar, background. Mitotic figures are easily found.  There is necrosis and microvascular proliferation.  Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block B1 for the IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per requisition form: 64-year-old male with brain tumor. Extraction of the patient's electronic medical record shows that this is a 64-year-old male who started to develop mild right temporal headaches and increased fatigue.

DONALD BORN M.D., Ph.D. Electronically signed 6/25/2015 3:35 PM *** ADDENDUM *** ADDENDUM REASON: This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with the EGFR probe set (Abbott Molecular) which identifies amplification of the EGFR gene on chromosome #7 and includes a chromosome #7 centromeric control probe (D7Z1). Unequivocal amplification is defined as innumerable EGFR signal (?10/cell) and an EGFR:Control ratio greater than 2.0.  Analysis of 25 nuclei was positive for amplification of the EGFR gene.  EGFR gene amplification is observed in glioblastoma. No. cells scored:   25 Average EGFR signals** / cell:     >10 EGFR signal range:  >10 Average Control signals / cell:    2.48 Control signal range:    2-3 EGFR:Control signal ratio:    4.03 *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical diagnostic purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. **Note:  Individual cell signal counts are arbitrarily truncated at 10 signals/cell because it is impossible to score accurately beyond that number.

Permanent sections from the prior resection in 9/2011 were also reviewed (SHS-11-32802).  The CUSA specimen confirms the presence of recurrent/residual glioblastoma; however in the other specimens we do not have definitive features of glioblastoma, and these specimens may represent reactive changes with radiation induced necrosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The CUSA contents (specimen D) shows some fragments with prominent vascular proliferation as well as nercrosis.  Other fragments contain astrocytes with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei, supporting the diagnosis of glioblastoma.  In the other specimens (A-C, E), we observe fragments of necrotic tissue, mild vascular proliferation, and grey matter with reactive gliosis, but the overall features fall short of definitive diagnosis of glioblastoma in those specimens. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per Epic, the patient is an 80 y/o female with history of GBM resected in 9/2011 which was positive for MGMT promoter methylation. She has received both radiation and chemotherapy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  RECEIVED 3 AIR DRIED SMEARS, 1 FIXED SMEAR AND VISIBLY ADEQUATE MATERIAL(TAN-RED SOFT TISSSUE CORE AGGREGATE MEASURING 1.5 X .1 X .1CM) FOR CELL BLOCK AND FLOW CYTOMETRY. CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: Adrenal, right, CT-GUIDED fine needle aspiration AND CORE BIOPSY      --   malignant (see comment) adrenal right, flow cytometry --   HETEROGENOUS T, B AND NK CELLS; NO LIGHT CHAIN RESTRICTED B CELL POPULATION BROWN/SEGAL/CHARVILLE/LEWIS/SAMGHABADI/GRATZINGER/SIBLEY/VOGEL/LONG DIAGNOSTIC COMMENTS:  The aspirate smears are moderately cellular and show scattered atypical cells with pleomorphic nuclei and vesicular chromatin, irregular nuclear contours, prominent nuclei, and moderate amounts of delicate cytoplasm in a background of normal adrenal cells. The cell block demonstrates predominantly necrotic tumor cells arranged in sheets. Immunohistochemistry shows the tumor is S100 negative, GFAP negative, inhibin negative, melanA negative, SF-1 negative, chromogranin A negative , synaptophysin positive, pancytokeratin negative, CK5/6 negative, CK7 negative, CK20 negative, SALL4 negative, NKX3.1 equivocal, INI-1 intact, CD45RB negative, CD30 negative, desmin negative, and p53 positive. This immunoprofile is non-specific and does not support a primary site. At this point the lesion represents a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. We have reviewed the prior brain biopsy (SHS-13-37730) demonstrating a well preserved malignant neoplasm with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. The current adrenal specimen shows similar nuclear features as the malignant neoplasm seen in the brain; however, the malignant neoplasm in the adrenal gland shows amphophilic cytoplasm and lacks eosinophilic cytoplasm. Of note, the adrenal sampling shows predominantly necrotic tumor cells so the amphophilic cytoplasm seen in this sampling may not be representative of the tumor as a whole. While we favor the two malignancies are of the same primary, we cannot exclude the possibility of a second primary.  Flow cytometry provides no support for a hematolymphoid neoplasm. Dr. Vogel and Dr. Sibley reviewed selected slides and concur with the diagnosis. Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended. IMMEDIATE EVALUATION:  Immediate evaluation of representative Diff-Quik stained slides via Nikon webcam showed adequate cellular material.  The stained slides have been reviewed by Dr. Steven Long.

The lymphocyte gate contains a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes, mostly T-cells with fewer B- and NK-cells.  B cells show polytypic light chain expression and unremarkable B cell antigen expression.  T and NK cells show expected reactivity with panel antibodies.

BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR #3, RESECTION --   FAVOR GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENTS) CLOETINGH/ZISKIN/PLOWEY/VOGEL/BORN COMMENTS:  Review of slides from intraoperative consultation proves concordant with the final diagnosis.  Histologic examination shows a partly inflamed neoplasm composed of malignant epithelioid cells with marked nuclear polymorphism, variably prominent nucleoli, moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and brisk mitotic activity.  The tumor largely appears to be well demarcated from the surrounding brain parenchyma, but rare highly atypical cells are found infiltrating adjacent gliotic brain at the neoplasm/parenchymal interface.  Additionally, slightly enlarged but less atypical cells (demonstrated in the immunohistochemical preparations described in the following paragraph) are also identified in the small amount of brain tissue.  Focal tumor necrosis is present.  No definite microvascular proliferation is identified.  In the immunohistochemical preparations undertaken the tumor does not express TTF-1, CK5/6, CK7, CK20, CKMIX, MiTF, IDH1 or HMB45, but does show diffuse immunoreactivity for p53.  Ki67 shows a high proliferation rate with occasional larger positive neoplastic cells infiltrating the brain.  S100 and GFAP show occasional positive large cells, that we interpret as neoplastic, within the tumor including positive mitotic figures.  Olig2 shows strong staining in mildly atypical cells within the gliotic brain as well as lighter staining more atypical cells.  The neoplastic cells are negative for olig2.  (Although conjecture, the olig2 findings suggest a spectrum of neoplastic glial cells with eventual loss of olig2 expression in the proliferative anaplastic majority of the tumor.)  The collective morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are highly suggestive of a very epithelioid glioblastoma.  Due to the lack of classic features, evaluation for another primary neoplasm is recommended. Dr. Donald Born discussed the diagnosis of ""favor glioblastoma"" with Dr. Iris Gibbs and Dr. Steven Chang at 11:30am on 10/9/2013.

BRAIN, DURA, RESECTION --   DURA WITH EXTENSIVE REACTIVE CHANGES CHAMBERS/BONANNO/BORN COMMENT:  We have reviewed the prior right parietal tumor resection (SHS-18-37834) for comparison to the current resection specimens and note similar morphology. MICROSCOPIC:  The morphologic features of specimens A, B and C are similar and will be described together. Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative proliferation of pleomorphic malignant cells characterized by enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with eosinophilic and occasionally vacuolated cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders.  Mitotic figures are readily identified (enumerated at up to 33 per 10 high-power microscopic fields). The tumor appears viable and does not display evidence of treatment effect. There is evidence of white matter radiation change characterized by loss of oligodendroglia and astrogliosis. Histologic sections of specimen D demonstrate dura with some more cellular areas of loose spindle cells.. CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year-old male with glioblastoma. Per medical record, the patient has a history of a right parietal glioblastoma, IDH1 R132H-wild type, MGMT negative, WHO grade IV who underwent resection in October 2017. Recently, he completed concurrent Temodar and radiation on 1/3/19 and began wearing Optune device.  MRI repeated on 1/27/19 demonstrating tumor recurrence. OPERATION: Occipital craniotomy for tumor resection.

BRAIN, RIGHT PARIETAL TUMOR, BIOPSIES (S13-011446 A & B; 7/30/2013) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) ZISKIN/VOGEL COMMENT:  Thank you for allowing us to review this case at the request of Dr. Soltys.  We agree with Dr. Pitman.  The provided histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate to abundant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by foci of necrosis and occasional vessels with microvascular proliferation.  While the histologic features are compatible with a high grade glioma, we performed an immunohistochemical for GFAP due to the request to rule out metastatic thyroid carcinoma.  The stain for GFAP is positive in the tumor cells, supporting the histologic impression of glioblastoma. CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year-old female with history of thyroid cancer 6 years ago and recent brain mass. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

Blasts do not appear visibly increased on the CD45/SSC plot.  CD34+ progenitors are not significantly increased, accounting for <1% of CD45+ events.  A gate on blasts is set with the aid of CD34 backgating, and contains a mixture of myeloid blasts, normal B precursors (hematogones) and maturing marrow elements. The lymphocyte gate contains a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes, mostly T cells with fewer B- and NK cells.  B cells show polytypic light chain expression and unremarkable B cell antigen expression.  T cells show unremarkable T cell antigen expression.  NK cells show expected reactivity with panel antibodies. Maturing granulocytes show an unremarkable pattern of CD13/CD16 expression.

ADDENDUM COMMENT: PD-L1 testing by IHC was performed and the tumor proportion score (TPS SCORE) shows 20% positivity and is interpreted as low PD-L1 expression. The PD-L1 antibody, SP263 was used on the Ventana Ultra platform. The antibody was validated against the PharmDx 22C3 PD-L1 assay.   Both positive and negative PD-L1 cases were used in the validation process. The FDA-approved scoring scheme in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC): 1. HIGH  PD-L1 expression: tumor proportion score  (TPS)  ? 50%; 2. LOW PD-L1 expression: 1-49%; 3. NO PD-L1 expression: <1%.

JOHNSON/KAMBHAM/HIGGINS/ZAMBRANO COMMENT:  Histologic sections of the right renal mass show a well-circumscribed proliferation of nests of cells with abundant oncocytic cytoplasm. These cells have primarily rounded nuclei. These features are suggestive of an oncocytoma. However, many cells have prominent nucleoli and there is increased vascularity compared to the typical oncocytoma. Instead, these features are more reminiscent of a conventional renal cell carcinoma. There appears to be some central cystic degeneration. No lymphovascular or fat invasion is identified. An immunohistochemical stain for CK7 shows only scattered positivity consistent with an oncocytoma. A stain for P504S is noncontributory. A PASd stain highlights arteriolosclerosis in the uninvolved background kidney parenchyma. On balance, we favor the diagnosis of an oncocytoma.  Dr. Neeraja Kambham and Dr. John Higgins have reviewed this case and agree with the diagnosis rendered.

We completely agree with the prior diagnosis of glioblastoma.  The accompanying pathology report indicates that additional molecular studies for MGMT promoter methylation along with FISH for PTEN and EGFR are pending. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background.  Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  The provided immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic cells stain positive for nuclear ATRX, negative for IDH1 R132H, and a subset of the nuclei show variably weak to moderate nuclear staining for P53. CLINICAL HISTORY:  77 year-old male with recent resection of a left parietal brain mass.

This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. Of note, this case has previously been reviewed and confirmed to be a Glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV (SHS-14-22330). I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

However, flow cytometry detects an abnormal kappa-restricted B cell population (32% of lymphocytes; 1.5 K/uL) without expression of CD5 or CD10. The differential diagnosis for a CD5-negative, CD10-negative monotypic B cell proliferation in the peripheral blood includes circulating marginal zone lymphoma, CD10-negative follicular lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, as well as other low grade B cell lymphomas. If the patient is found to have no further evidence of lymphoproliferative disease (e.g. lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, monoclonal gammopathy, etc.) by clinical evaluation, the abnormal population in the current study would best be classified as a monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis of undetermined significance, non-CLL type.  Clinical correlation with appropriate follow up is recommended. CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old male with glioblastoma and history of thrombocytopenia. A recent peripheral blood smear showed a subset of lymphocytes with blocky chromatin in a background of heterogeneous small, mature lymphocytes. Flow cytometry is performed to evaluate for CLL.

Histologic sections of the current right frontal and peripheral tumor (Specimens A and B) show extensive areas of necrosis with scattered pleomorphic astrocytes found at low density, consistent with treated tumor cells. Other areas of the tissue show gliosis and hyalinized vasculature. There are no areas of mitotic activity or high tumor cellularity, as seen in the initial resection specimen (SHS-15-16145). Altogether, the morphologic findings are compatible with ""pseudoprogression,"" or the presence of residual, treated tumor without ""active"" disease (Woodworth et al.). Relative to patients with ""active"" disease, patients with pseudoprogression in one case series had longer survival from the time of their second tumor resection, however their survival from the time of the primary tumor resection was not significantly lengthened (Woodworth et al.). Dr. Born has seen the case and agrees with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old female with glioblastoma multiforme. OPERATION: Craniotomy for tumor resection.

We agree with your diagnostic impression of glioblastoma.  Our immunohistochemical test for IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. Testing for MGMT promoter methylation by PCR is pending and the results will be reported as an addendum.  Dr. Soo-Ryum Yang discussed this case with Dr. Alexandra Riechman at 4/9/14 at 10:30. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed this case and agrees with our diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show variably cellular proliferation of neoplastic astrocytes with marked nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism. Necrosis, microvascular proliferation and mitotic figures are readily identified. No definite oligodendroglioma features are seen. Immunohistochemistry prepared in our laboratory for IDH1 R132H mutation using submitted unstained slides is negative.

DONALD BORN M.D., Ph.D. Electronically signed 4/13/2015 5:05 PM ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report that testing for possible MGMT promoter methylation. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL MASS, RESECTION SAMPLE (RS15-01565 A-C; 4/2/15)      --   NEGATIVE FOR PROMOTER METHYLATION OF THE MGMT GENE ADDENDUM COMMENT: MGMT promoter methylation was evaluated using methylation specific PCR Methylation-specific PCR followed by agarose gel detection and interpreted by K. Wilson, MD; Ph.D.  This sample was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Absence of MGMT gene methylation indicates a less favorable prognosis as compared to presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26. In individuals with a negative result for this test, the benefit of chemotherapeutic treatment with alkylating agents is less clear than in patients with methylation of the MGMT gene. Furthermore, a negative result is associated with shorter progression free and overall survival.   There is no change to the original diagnosis. Disclaimer: Molecular diagnostic test results should be interpreted in the context of standard clinical, laboratory and pathological findings. Molecular genetic test results impart a probabilistic risk of disease. In order to derive the most meaningful benefit from this testing, it is recommended that the results and subsequent options from these complex tests be discussed with patients by a trained genetics professional. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling, as well as clonal/signal density below the level of detection. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis, including deletions or polymorphisms in primer binding sites which prevent allele amplification. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ('CLIA') as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

Dr. Donald Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slide and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis. Sections show a cellular infiltrating glial neoplasm with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on block A2 and show the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H (wild-type). P53 highlights a subset of tumor cells, ATRX is retained, and the Ki-67 proliferation index is moderately high (estimated at 10%). CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year-old woman with a history of breast DCIS, s/p surgery in 11/2016 followed with RT and tamoxifen, with routine biannual MRI of chest showing no new lesions. In 11/2019, she had sudden onset of loss of consciousness and work up revealed a subacute to chronic right SDH with herniation. Post-op MRI showed a left frontal multifocal process with a dominant white matter lesion and two cortically based lesion with hyperperfusion and slight interval growth. The imaging findings are concerning for multifocal glioma. Metastasis and demyelinating lesions are thought to be less likely. OPERATION: MRI guided left brain biopsy ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies can performed on block A2, which contains approximately 50% tumor.

A brain MRI study performed on April 10, 2008 demonstrated a 5 cm, rim-enhancing, left frontal lobe mass with extensive edema and midline shift.  The radiologic differential diagnosis included astrocytoma, glioblastoma, ependymoma, and germ cell tumor.  The originating pathologist describes a glioblastoma (outside case SVS-08-00756). GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Five slides labeled SVS-08-00756 are received courtesy of Dr. James Hannah of Central Coast Pathology Consultants in San Luis Obispo, California.  The slides include a squash preparation labeled Â¿B-1,Â¿ two H&E-stained slides labeled Â¿B1-3Â¿ and Â¿C1-1,Â¿ and immunohistochemical stains for GFAP and keratin (broad spectrum keratin AE1/AE3) performed on block C.  A copy of the pathology report is received as well. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Sections show a moderately cellular neoplasm composed of cells with ovoid-to-angular, pleomorphic nuclei set in a fibrillar background.  Subsets of tumor cells variably show a gemistocytic appearance with eccentric eosinophilic cytoplasm and perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing.  Frequent mitotic figures are observed.  Vascular proliferation and widespread necrosis are identified.  Tumor cells show GFAP reactivity and are negative for keratin. COMMENT:  We are in agreement with the originating pathologist.  Due to the presence of focal perinuclear clearing suggestive of oligodendroglial differentiation, consideration is given to a diagnosis of Â¿glioblastoma with oligodendroglial features.Â¿ Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for chromosomes 1p and 19q deletion will be performed upon receipt of a tissue block.

This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis.  The diagnosis is unchanged. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two dual-color probe sets (Vysis) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Both hybridization attempts failed to yield scorable FISH signals, precluding 1p/19q deletion analysis.  This failure could be due to specimen processing that differs from the method used by Stanford surgical pathology. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

Sections of the brain biopsy demonstrate a highly cellular glial neoplasm composed of poorly differentiated astrocytic tumor cells with marked nuclear atypia, nuclear pleomorphism, and brisk  mitotic activity. Multinucleate giant cells are also noted.  Large areas of necrosis and neovacularization are seen. Stains for reticulin and PAS are performed on block A4.  The reticulin stains predominantly highlight the matrix of the foci of microvascular proliferation.  PAS stains do not highlight the neoplastic cells.

The patient's young age,  and the presence of multinucleated pleomorphic neoplastic astrocytes and abundance of histiocytes led us to consider the diagnosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA).  However, large areas of necrosis and a brisk mitotic index with aberrant mitotic figures are not characteristic of PXA. It is possible, however that the glioblastoma multiforme may have  arisen from a PXA.. I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

A CT scan with and without contrast demonstrated a ring enhancing circumferential mass, measuring approximately 4.5 x 3.0 cm, located in the anterior left temporal lobe.  Perilesional edema was noted, as well as an irregular neovascularity arising from the left middle cerebral artery.  There was effacement of the Sylvian fissure.  The lateral ventricles are midline with no midline shift. There is no obstruction, dilatation of the lateral ventricles or a significant mass effect.  No additional lesions are seen. Radiographic impression is a primary glial tumor, most likely glioblastoma multiforme, given the presence of a ring enhancing mass with neovascularity. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:   Favor a glioblastoma multiforme. GROSS DESCRIPTION:   Received from Central Oregon Pathology Consultants in Bend, Oregon, are total of eight (8) slides consisting of two (2) H&E stains (SCS-01-12860, FS A1-1 and B-1 H&E), as well as six (6) special stains (SCS-01-12860 A1-1 GFAP, CD3, CD20) with representative controls.  In addition, two paraffin blocks (S.1260-01, FS A and B), as well as a copy of a letterhead and surgical pathology report are also received. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections reveal fragments of markedly hypercellular anaplastic tumor.  The majority of the tumor cells show small, hyperchromatic angulated and sometimes round nuclei with scant cytoplasm. Prominent endothelial proliferation, neovascularization and rare mitotic figures are identified. A small focus of questionable necrosis is also seen.

The reported clinical history is that of a 60 year old female who sustained minor head trauma and imaging evaluation demonstrated a 2.5 cm hyperdense enhancing lesion in the right posterior parietal area. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the submitted specimens (A-C) demonstrate involvement by a morphologically analogous neoplastic process and will be described together.  Sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of round to elongate pleomorphic cells with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  A subpopulation of the cells with round nuclei additionally demonstrates perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing.  Frequent mitotic figures are identified and focal tumor cell necrosis is additionally seen.  Review of a GFAP immunostain performed demonstrates strong staining positivity within the lesional cells as well as additionally highlights a prominent microvascular proliferation in areas of absent staining.  Review of a Ki67 stain performed demonstrates a robust proliferation index (approximately 50%). COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this case in consultation.  We agree completely with the outside rendered evaluation of this lesion as a glioblastoma.  Given the presence of a cellular subpopulation with more round nuclei and perinuclear clearing consideration was given towards a glioblastoma with an oligodendroglioma component (GBO).  However, this is a subset designation within the overall classification as a glioblastoma and the majority of cells within this lesion have the characteristic pleomorphic angular astrocyte cell morphology of a traditional glioblastoma.

One month ago, she began having frequent emesis and her cognitive problems became more severe. An MRI scan showed left hemispheric lesions in the posterior frontal/parietal lobe and in the periventricular region.  On serial scanning, these did not appear to be directly connected.  The patient underwent a resection of her more posteriorly based lesion which was diagnosed as glioblastoma at an outside institution. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received, at the request of Dr. Lawrence Recht, from Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, California are 5 H & E stained slides and 1 paraffin tissue block labeled S06-2901.  The received slides are additionally labeled 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 3. MICROSCOPIC:  The sections show partially cauterized fragments of a highly cellular neoplasm with a fibrillar background.  The neoplastic cells have mildly enlarged, angulated, hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin.  Focal areas contain neoplastic cells with round to oval nuclei.  Numerous mitotic figures are noted. Vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  A large area of geographic necrosis is also included. COMMENT:  We agree with the outside pathologist's diagnosis in this case.  Some areas of this neoplasm, however, are suggestive of an oligodendroglial phenotype.

We have also reviewed selected slides of the prior resection specimen (SHS-07-37503) and concur with the diagnosis of glioblastoma.  The permanent sections of the current specimen demonstrate portions of cortex and subjacent white matter. The white matter is regionally hypercellular and contains a focally dense infiltrate of macrophages.  Scattered modestly enlarged atypical cells with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei are present in the white matter.  Some of these cells are vacuolated.  No definite mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation or pseudopalisading necrosis is identified.  Some of the included white matter vessels have sclerotic walls.  To evaluate the proliferative activity of the atypical cells, Ki-67 immunohistochemical stains are performed on all blocks.  There is a mild increase in proliferative activity, which does not clearly include the atypical cell population. COMMENT:  The rare atypical cells within this specimen could be compatible with radiation related changes; however we cannot exclude the possibility that the atypical cells represent residual/recurrent neoplasm.

This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis.  The above diagnosis remains unchanged. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two dual-color probe sets (Vysis) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Two hundred cells were scored for each probe set.  Abnormal 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns were observed in 5.5% and 2% of analyzed cells, respectively.  Normal 1p36 and the 19q13 signal patterns were observed in 59% and 66% of nuclei, respectively.  The remaining nuclei demonstrated low level variable patterns consistent with aneuploidy without relative deletion and/or sectioning error or hybridization inefficiency. The observed levels of deletion signal pattern are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

We agree with your impression of a high grade glioma.  The morphology and immunohistochemistry lead us to favor glioblastoma.  We note and appreciate that you initiated additional IDH1/IDH2 mutational analysis.  In the event that an IDH1/IDH2 mutation is found, an anaplastic oligodendroglioma remains a possibility.  If this is IDH1/IDH2 wild type, given the location of this mass in the right thalamus, a diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant, must also be considered.  This WHO grade IV glioma can demonstrate overlapping morphologic features with glioblastoma.  Mutational analysis for H3 K27M can be performed at Stanford upon the receipt of materials. In addition, next generation sequencing, that includes for genes relevant to prognosis in glioblastoma, is available as part of Stanford's solid tumor actionable mutation panel (STAMP).  Findings of any additional testing will be reported when available as a follow-up to this report. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

We agree that the findings are those of glioblastoma. Due to the markedly variable immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) we considered gliosarcoma as a possible diagnosis; this is not supported by the pattern of reticulin staining. Dr. McGinnis communicated these results to Dr. Spinosa at Scripps Memorial Hospital on 11/25/14 at 6:30 PM. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis above. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate an infiltrative neoplasm characterized by heterogeneous architecture and cytology.  The neoplastic cells in different areas appear as packed small cells, epithelioid sheets and lobules and spindled with vague fascicles.  The nuclei are correspondingly variable but overall can be characterized as hyperchromatic with irregular nuclear contours, coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The morphology of the cytoplasm is quite diverse corresponding to the architecture. There are mitotic figures including some that are quite abnormal.  Microvascular proliferation and necrosis (including pseudopallisading) is prominent.  A reticulin stain prepared on a provided unstained slide demonstrates abundant perivascular staining but only rare instances of pericellular staining (not correlated with GFAP immuno-negative areas). A panel of immunohistochemistry performed at the outside hospital show the neoplastic cells are positive for S100 and GFAP while negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, p63, CD10, CDX2, PSA, CD30, HMB45, MART-1 and CAM5.2. In several areas large groups of GFAP positive cells are seen to alternate with GFAP negative cells.

Rogers for Neuropath/mkb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Permanent sections confirm the intraoperative frozen section and cytologic diagnoses of both meningioma and glioblastoma.  Histologic sections from the right frontal mass (block A1) show a hypercellular astrocytic neoplasm that displays moderate to focally marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei and moderately dense eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitotic activity is identified.  Areas of pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are present.  Multiple areas are noted where the neoplastic cells display round nuclei and surrounding clear cytoplasm, an appearance suggestive of an oligodendroglioma.  Histologic sections from the dural nodule (blocks B1 and B2) show a neoplasm composed of large and small syncytial nests of meningothelial cells with numerous whorls.  The neoplastic meningothelial cells display mild nuclear pleomorphism, occasional small nucleoli, nuclear pseudoinclusions, and eosinophilic syncytial cytoplasm.  No brain parenchyma is identified.  Atypical features and significant mitotic activity are not found.  The dura shows reactive meningothelial and vascular endothelial cells.  There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry:  In order to further evaluate the dural nodule, immunohistochemical stains for CD34, EMA, GFAP, and Ki67 were performed.  The dural neoplasm (block B2) stains diffusely positive for EMA and is negative for CD34, supporting the diagnosis of meningioma.  Ki67 highlights scattered cells ranging from <1-5%. The attached dura (block B1) does not stain with EMA or GFAP, supporting no involvement by meningioma or glioblastoma.

The methylation results show a high-confidence match to the WHO CNS 2021 entity ""diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4"" with methylation subclass ""RTK1 type, subclass A"" (see Addendum). This entity is a high-grade glioma seen in children, adolescents, or young adults with histologic features of glioblastoma, wildtype H3 and IDH, and a methylation profile of this class. Under the WHO 2016 classification, this entity would have been classified as ""glioblastoma, IDH-wild-type, WHO grade 4"", consistent with the prior diagnosis. Thus, the amendment reflects the methylation classification match to this new entity as well as the updated WHO CNS 2021 nomenclature. Of note, hypermutated tumors such as those arising in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency or Lynch syndrome may show a favorable response to immunotherapy (see reference).

Variants of unknown significance were also detected and are described in the complete report available in Epic (accession 20H-086MP0019).  The revisions to the diagnosis and this amendment comment are the only changes to the report.  MGMT promoter methylation testing is underway and will be reported separately in the electronic medical record, Epic.  Further clinical correlation is suggested. MUTATIONS DETECTED BY NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING (STAMP): NF1 F1247fs (Pathogenic) NF1 c.4575_4577+5delCAGGTAAG (Likely Pathogenic) TP53 G245S (Pathogenic) TP53 R306X (Pathogenic) COMMENT:  The diagnosis of malignant glioma is made pending further molecular characterization.   Sequencing to assess for alternate IDH mutations as well as other mutations with diagnostic and treatment implications (STAMP) is ordered.   Results will be incorporated into a revised diagnosis. Drs. Inma Cobos and Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concur with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We reviewed the cytologic preparation and frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis. Histologic sections from all parts demonstrate a highly cellular glial proliferation with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. Many giant and multinucleate forms with bizarre morphology are seen. Frequent mitotic figures, prominent microvascular proliferation, and focal necrosis with peripheral pseudopalisading are present. Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block A2 is positive for p53 (mutated, highlights the tumor cell nuclei, including some of the giant/multinucleated examples), is negative for IDH-1 R132H (not mutated) and shows retained ATRX (not mutated). CLINICAL HISTORY: 36-year-old female with 5 cm glioma OPERATION: Craniotomy MRI guided ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies were performed on block A2, which contains approximately 60% neoplastic cells. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: TPA/FSA: RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR      --   HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA      (AHMADIAN/BORN) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Three specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""right temporal tumor"" is received fresh from the operating room and consists of three fragments of brain parenchyma ranging in size from 0.8-1.2 cm. The specimen is partially submitted for touch prep and frozen section diagnosis as TPA/FSA. The frozen remnant is wrapped in biopsy paper and submitted in cassette A1. Remainder of the specimen is wrapped in biopsy paper and submitted in cassette A2.   Echague (3/19/2020) The second specimen labeled ""cusa contents"" is received in formalin and consists of a suction bag containing multiple disrupted fragments of tan-pink soft tissue admixed with blood clots, aggregate 13.4 x 5.4 x 0.4 cm.  Representative sections are submitted in nine cassettes B1-B9. The third specimen labeled ""right temporal tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of two pale tan to pink fragments of soft tissue, aggregate 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.4  centimeters.  The specimen is serially sectioned, wrapped, and entirely submitted in one cassette C1.  Reboja (3/19/2020) ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report an additional immunohistochemistry that was requested by Dr. Chirag Patel. ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC: Immunohistochemistry for the H3 K27M mutation protein was performed on sections from block C1 and shows the neoplastic cells are negative. ADDENDUM COMMENT: There is no change in the diagnosis. AHMADIAN/BORN ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to describe the results of immunohistochemical staining to evaluate for microsatellite instability. Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins demonstrate loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression with intact expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in the tumor cells. These findings suggest microsatellite instability in this tumor. Tumors that demonstrate loss of the mismatch repair protein MSH6 are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary syndrome that causes increased risk for certain cancers, including glioblastoma. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR, BIOPSY --   LOSS OF MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS MSH2 AND MSH6      (SEE MMR COMMENT) TOLAND/VOGEL ADDENDUM: MOLECULAR TESTING: This addendum is issued to describe the results of methylation-based tumor classification performed at the NIH/NCI based on samples from the neoplasm as unstained sections from block A2. Methylation-based profiling is not currently approved for prognostic or diagnostic use and is reported from research findings. ADDENDUM COMMENT: The methylation-based profiling indicates a high confidence match to the ""glioblastoma, pediatric RTK1 type, subclass A"" class, which is also known as ""diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, RTK1 type, subclass A"". Additional evaluation with UMAP dimensionality reduction analysis and NCI-EPIC methylation classifier also provide support for this classification. The previous WHO CNS 2016 terminology for this tumor is ""glioblastoma, IDH wild type, WHO grade 4"", consistent with the original diagnosis. However, the 2021 WHO CNS Classification introduced a novel category of high-grade gliomas that predominantly occur in children, adolescents, or young adults named "" diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4"" and the methylation profile aligns with this new group rather than adult-type diffuse IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.  We note the prior sequencing results showed no molecular features of conventional glioblastoma such as TERT promoter mutation or trisomy 7/monosomy 10.  Diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma and glioblastoma are both high-grade gliomas with microvascular proliferation and necrosis, wildtype for H3 and IDH, and both can show EGFR amplification although no amplification was seen in this tumor.  High-grade glioma arising in the setting of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome and Lynch syndrome are over-represented in the RTK1 type methylation class of diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, although tumors of this class can also be seen in sporadic cases or in association with cranial irradiation.  To incorporate the methylation classification and the 2021WHO CNS nomenclature, the diagnosis will be revised in an amendment. References: 1.  Capper D, Jones DTW, et. al.

The original diagnosis is unchanged. MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins demonstrate loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression with intact expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in the tumor cells. These findings provide strong support for microsatellite instability. Tumors that demonstrate loss of the mismatch repair protein MSH6 are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary syndrome that causes increased risk for certain cancers. Due to the finding of MSH2 and MSH6 deficiency in this patient's tumor, genetic counselling is recommended. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of solid tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and select gynecologic oncology patients may benefit from this treatment.

This classification scheme is based on the molecularly defined subgroups identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (PMID: 23636398; 26763250; 25505230; 28061006). The diagnosis remains unchanged. Of note, the p53, ER, PR, and DNA mismatch immunohistochemistry studies were previously reviewed and reported in the prior addendum, but are reported here again in this addendum for completeness. POLE COMMENT:  No POLE hotspot mutations were detected using a SNaPshot assay. Please refer to results in EPIC for additional details. BETA-CATENIN COMMENT:  An immunohistochemical stain for beta-catenin shows membranous staining but also shows focal areas with strong cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells obscuring nuclear localization assessment. This is interpreted as equivocal with respect to mutant type; however, confirmatory molecular testing could be performed if clinically indicated. Dr. Brooke Howitt has reviewed this stain and agrees the beta-catenin stain is equivocal. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A.

The patient's prior resection was reviewed at Stanford (SHS-15-19247) and the present neoplasm has similar features.  MGMT promoter methylation studies were performed on tissue from the prior resection and the results were negative (not methylated, 15H-198MP0020). Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the resection specimens (A-D) reveal the tissue is quite heterogeneous including variably cellular infiltrating neoplasm, necrosis, foreign material, granulation tissue, hemorrhage and cerebral cortex without definite abnormality. The neoplastic proliferation is composed of malignant glia with enlarged and pleomorphic nuclei, coarse chromatin, nuclear contour irregularities and scant cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is moderate with 1 mitotic figure per high power field in high cellularity areas and there are abnormal mitotic figures.  There is abundant necrosis, including pseudopalisading necrosis.  Microvascular proliferation and macrophage rich regions are also features.  Foreign material appears to be surgical. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per the requisition form: History of glioblastoma. Extracting from the electronic medical record we note that the patient is a 73 year old female with a history of glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV status post resection April 2015 (see SHS-15-19247 for details).  There was a postoperative infection.  She now presents with seizures and a right parietal mass that has grown despite therapy. Present surgery is for debulking.

We entirely agree with the submitted diagnosis. Sections reveal an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with round to ovoid nuclei, coarse chromatin and minimal cytoplasm. Abundant mitotic activity is noted, and both necrosis and microvascular proliferation are identified. The provided GFAP and Vimentin show variable staining. The monotonous nature of the tumor with small cell features raises the possibility of a small cell subtype of glioblastoma. Testing for EGFR amplification could be done if clinically warranted.

Sections demonstrate a highly anaplastic neoplasm characterized by large pleomorphic cells with increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, smudgy chromatin, variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli.  Mitotic figures are abundant, including numerous atypical figures.  Occasional tumor giant cells are present and there are focal areas of necrosis.  The tumor has variable patterns with some areas demonstrating myxoid features with spindle-shaped cells that surround aggregates around vessels and others showing features that are more suggestive of neural differentiation. Immunohistochemistry:  GFAP and S100 stains highlight the tumor cells in a patchy pattern but focally some cells stain strongly for GFAP.  In addition, the malignant cells stain strongly for Ki-67 (MIB-1)(20-30%) and p53 (15%).  Reticulin stains highlight a dense reticulin matrix which is deposited primarily in the areas with the prominent myxoid stroma and spindle-shaped cells.  Rare scattered tumor cells are also positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and CAM 5.2. The tumor does not stain with HMB-45 or synaptophysin stains.

Cytokeratin staining of rare cells is found in some glioblastomas.  The biphasic tissue pattern, i.e., malignant glial areas and GFAP-negative, reticulin rich mesenchymal areas, suggests the classification of this highly anaplastic tumor as a gliosarcoma.

MRI on 3/7/02 showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass closely associated with the left tentorium in the left temporal lobe (5.8 x 4.9 x 3 cm), with central areas of edema or necrosis and a significant mass effect. A recent MRI-guided stereotactic biopsy at Stanford showed anaplastic astrocytoma (NP 13557). Of note, the patient has a history of diffuse large cell lymphoma of the right posterior mandible diagnosed in November 1998, for which he received radiation. He also has a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness from a fall in October 2001; CT at that time showed no acute changes. OPERATION:   Left frontal craniotomy for awake removal of tumor. OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  MRI for stereotactic localization again demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing mass within the left temporal lobe with central areas of edema or necrosis and adjacent mass effect with some left-to-right midline shift. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:   Temporal lobe mass. OR CONSULT:   The specimen was picked up from the operating room. GROSS DESCRIPTION:   The first specimen designated ""anterior lobe mass"" is received in a container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a fragment of hemorrhagic soft tissue (3 x 2 x 1 cm) with yellow gelatinous necrotic debris. One-half of the specimen is frozen for research, and the remainder is fixed in formalin and entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A3. The next specimen designated ""additional tumor"" is received in a container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number, and consists of a fragment of hemorrhagic soft tissue (6 x 4 x 2 cm) with areas of gelatinous yellow-brown tumor.  One-half of the specimen is frozen for research and the remainder is fixed in formalin.  A pilot section is submitted in cassette B1, and the remainder of the specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes B2-B7. The next specimen designated ""normal temporal lobe tissue"" is received in a container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a fragment of white-pink tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, which is grossly consistent with normal brain tissue.  The specimen is fixed in formalin and entirely submitted in cassette C.  McLucas/pal The next specimen designated ""tumor attached to dura"" is received in a formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and consists of a fragment of tan to hemorrhagic tissue with central yellow gelatinous appearing tissue. A small fragment of tissue grossly consistent with dura is attached to one side of the specimen. The fragment is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette D. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Slides from the previous stereotactic biopsy (SHS 02-7100) have been reviewed and confirm the diagnosis of a highly anaplastic glial neoplasm. The current specimen shows a markedly cellular neoplasm composed of tumor cells displaying pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei with variable amounts of cytoplasm. In some areas, the tumor cells become more spindle-shaped with myxoid change. Numerous mitotic figures (up to 15 per 20x field), some aberrant, prominent pseudopalisading necrosis, and endothelial cell proliferation are readily identified.

He has a history of diffuse large cell lymphoma of the right posterior mandible diagnosed in November 1998 and also has a history of new onset of seizures and head trauma in October 2001.  A head CT performed on October 5 and October 6, 2001 showed a prominent left parietal extra-axial space, extensive bilateral white matter changes, a recent tiny infarct in the left parahippocampal region, but were negative for tumor.  The patient was admitted for a MRI guided stereotactic OPERATION:   Left temporal MRI guided stereotactic biopsy of brain mass. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Left temporal brain mass.

Portions of all smaller fragments are frozen as FS1.  The remaining frozen tissue is entirely submitted for permanent sectioning in cassette FS1.  The remaining unfrozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette X1. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of high-grade glioma, probable anaplastic astrocytoma.  They show cores of brain tissue with a moderately to markedly cellular neoplasm. The vast majority of tumor cells display pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures, some aberrant, are identified.  Pseudopalisading around necrosis and endothelial cell proliferation/neovascularization are not identified in this sample. Review of the slides of the patient's prior specimen ""Soft and hard tissue right posterior mandible"" (Sequoia Hospital: total of three (3) slides labeled as S-6366-98 A through C and copy of the surgical pathology report) show a markedly cellular neoplasm, lacking a fibrillary background, composed of sheets of discohesive mononuclear cells.  Nuclear atypia and prominent necrosis are identified. COMMENT: We have reviewed the patient's prior material (see above) and concur with the diagnosis of lymphoma.  The present specimen reveals a malignant glial neoplasm and has features distinct from the prior lymphoma.  The present biopsy demonstrates an anaplastic astrocytoma.  The lack of necrosis and endothelial cell proliferation/neovascularization precludes the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme in this sample.

Representative sections of the tumor were sent for FISH analysis for 19q and 1p deletions. Dr. Perry concurs with the diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. However, he believes the area suspicious for a possible oligodendroglial component more likely reflects a small cell variant of glioblastoma.  No evidence for 1p and 19q deletions were found. Additional FISH analysis demonstrated gains of chromosome 7 and 10q deletions, further supporting the diagnosis of glioblastoma.   The original diagnosis remains unchanged.

BRAIN, DEEP TUMOR, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH1 R132H WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 CHIRIELEISON/TOLAND/AHMADIAN/BORN COMMENT:  The specimens contain an infiltrating glioma that is difficult to precisely characterize on morphologic features as there are findings associated with both astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. The histology is generally low grade and without microvascular proliferation or necrosis.  As the ATRX and p53 wild type pattern can be seen in oligodendroglioma, additional molecular studies have been initiated, including FISH for possible deletions of 1p and 19q. Further classification of the tumor will be made in an addendum to this report when the results are available. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: There is a diffusely infiltrating glial neoplasm characterized by moderately increased cellularity, scattered small calcifications, satellitosis, delicate branching capillaries, and variable nuclei that are somewhat elongated with irregular contours.  There are up to 2 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields.  Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block B1 demonstrate the neoplastic cells to be negative for IDH R132H (wild-type), positive for ATRX (retained/wild-type), and variably positive for p53 (wild-type pattern). CLINICAL HISTORY: Per the Pathology Tissue Exam Request:  76 yr-old female with right frontal brain mass.  In the electronic health record, Epic, we find Mary Gonzales has a history of HTN, HLD, GERD and hyperparathyroidism who presented following an episode of left facial twitching and numbness. Imaging showed a heterogeneous, contrast enhancing, cortical and subcortical mass with internal calcification, centered within the right frontal operculum.  Given the imaging appearance, calcification, and location, there is consideration for an oligodendroglioma, while contrast enhancement as well as increased cerebral blood volume and hyperperfusion suggest the possibility of a higher grade glioma. OPERATION: Right craniotomy for tumor resection ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block B1, which contains approximately 60% tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FSA/SPA: BRAIN TUMOR      --   HIGH GRADE GLIOMA      (Toland/Born) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Four specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""brain tumor"" is received fresh from the operating room and consists of multiple fragments of tan-red tissue, measuring 2.8 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm in aggregate.  A representative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis FSA.  The remnant of FSA is wrapped and submitted in cassette A1. The second specimen labeled ""brain tumor"" is received fresh from the operating room and consists of one tan fragment of tissue, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm.  A representative section is submitted to Stanford tissue bank.  Remaining tissue is wrapped and submitted in cassette B1. Cobain (6/14/2021) The third specimen labeled ""superficial brain tumor and sonopet contents"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple disrupted fragments of light tan-pink soft tissue, aggregate 3.3 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. Submitted with the container is an opened suction bag with free-floating light tan soft tissue, aggregate 4.5 x 3.0 x 0.2 cm. The larger fragments are serially sectioned and wrapped, smaller free-floating fragments are filtered and entirely submitted in five cassettes C1-C5 The fourth specimen labeled ""deep brain tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple disrupted fragments of light tan soft tissue, aggregate 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is wrapped and entirely submitted in one cassette D1.  Reboja (6/14/2021) ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to describe the results of next generation sequencing-based mutational profiling using the UCSF 500 panel. MOLECULAR TESTING:  Tissue samples in the form of unstained sections from block B1 were submitted to the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory.  The UCSF 500 sequencing panel results are listed below. All variants considered ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"" are reported here. --   TERT c.-146C>T PROMOTER MUTATION --   TRISOMY CHROMOSOME 7 --   FGFR3-NBR1 FUSION ADDENDUM COMMENT:  TERT promoter mutations are frequently reported in glioblastomas and, in the setting of the present histology and absence of an IDH1/2 mutation, predicts clinical behavior similar to glioblastoma WHO grade 4 (see reference 1), and in the 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, are designated as glioblastoma, IDH wild-type, WHO grade 4 (see reference 2).  Trisomy 7 is also frequently identified in glioblastomas, though concurrent monosomy 10 is required as support for molecular features of glioblastoma.  An amended report will be released to incorporate the molecular findings into an integrated diagnosis.

MICROSCOPIC:  Sections of the right head wound tissue (A) show predominantly recent necrosis of cortical brain tissue with extensive acute inflammation. The bone flap (B) shows fragments of devitalized bone with fibrosis and chronic inflammation. No evidence of viable tumor is seen. CLINICAL HISTORY: Meningitis.  Extracting from the electronic medical record we find this patient is a 52-year-old male with a R parietal glioblastoma (MGMT negative, EGFRvIII+) who had near total resection 6/12/12 at an outside hospital, followed by radiation therapy and 9 cycles of TMZ.  He had re-resection for recurrence 9/2013, also at an outside hospital. This post operative course was complicated by skin infection treated with 2 weeks of antibiotics and presumed resolution of the infection.  He received 2 cycles of avastin and entered the ReACT vaccine trial. Prior to admission he had sudden onset headaches about 4 days ago, somewhat progressive. This was associated with neck stiffness and feeling unwell. Lumbar puncture for CSF revealed inflammatory cells. MRI revealed diffuse meningitis and ventriculitis and he began to leak pus out of his wound. OPERATION: Wound washout and removal of bone GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Specimens A and B have a relatively small portion of neoplastic appearing cells while some fragments in C show higher cellularity neoplasm.  We previously reviewed the biopsy and resection from this region that show glioblastoma (SHS-14-40050).  While the present resection does not have the cellularity and pseudopalisading necrosis seen previously, the cytologic features are generally similar such that we consider there to be glioblastoma present. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections from all specimens, A-C, have brain tissue and leptomeninges.  In all specimens there are areas of coagulative necrosis with remnant structures that in some areas have features of brain tissue and in others have vessels as would be seen in a tumor.  White matter areas have, in addition, extensive areas nearly replaced by gemistocytic astrocytes, some areas nearly replaced by macrophages and minor areas that are intermediate but also have neoplastic appearing nuclei.  The gray matter has areas that are recognizable cortex while others are mostly reactive appearing glia.  As in the white matter there are areas with highly atypical nuclei that appear neoplastic and occasional multinucleated cells.  We found a rare mitotic figure in surveys of numerous high power fields.  Vascular changes include thick-walled blood vessels, clusters of small vascular spaces with enlarged endothelial cell nuclei and microvascular proliferation. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Per the Tissue Exam Request form:  52 y/o with glioblastoma. Extracting from the electronic medical record we find Michael Holt had biopsy of left frontal tumor February 2013, adjuvant therapy, resection then additional treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. MRI was then considered stable for a period while a recent MRI revealed an area of enhancement in the region of the prior resection. OPERATION: Left frontal craniotomy for tumor resection.

There is microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. Histologic sections of the resection specimen (specimen B) show that much of the neoplasm is less cellular than the original biopsy. Nonetheless, the lesion has similar cytology and some areas are equally cellular. There are small areas of coagulative necrosis that account for approximately 5% of sampled tissue.

Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis above. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of specimens A-C show pleomorphic astrocytic neoplastic cells with marked nuclear atypia and mitotic figures including atypical forms (easily finding 3 mitotic figures in a high power field) forming cystic and solid areas.  Some of the solid areas are composed of spindle cells arranged in fascicles. Microvascular proliferation, pseudopalisading necrosis and non-pseudopalisading coagulative necrosis are also present. Multiple thrombosed vessels and chronic inflammation with perivascular cuffing are seen.  Reticulin special stain and immunohistochemistry for GFAP, IDH-1, and MGMT are performed on sections from block B2.  Reticulin stain shows in some areas (in particular more spindle areas) a rich pericellular staining.  Other areas have only vascular-associated reticulin.  GFAP is uniformly immunoreactive in the neoplastic cells except in some of the spindle cell areas where there is more variable immunoreactivity. Immunohistochemistry for the IDH-1 R132H mutation is negative (alternative mutation in IDH1 or IDH2 is not excluded). CLINICAL HISTORY: None provided.  In the electronic medical record we find this patient is a 77-year-old male presenting with recent episodes of left-sided weakness, possible seizures with involuntary left finger movements and mild cognitive decline. CT scan showed a large, 7 cm in maximum diameter, multilobulated, multicystic mass of the right parietal region that involves both the cortex and subcortical white matter.

BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL DURAL BASE, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV CARNEAL/BORN COMMENT:  MGMT promoter methylation PCR is being performed on block A2 and the results will be available in EPIC when completed. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The H&E stained sections of fixed tissue from parts A and B reveal an infiltrating neoplastic proliferation of pleomorphic glial cells with quite variable nuclear and cytoplasmic features that include spindle cell and epithelioid components (specimen B). There are numerous mitotic figures, clustered/glomeruloid microvessels and areas of pseudopalisading necrosis. Additionally, large dilated vascular spaces, some with intervening brain tissue, are also seen in the sections from B along with a prominent fibrous component within the neoplasm.  Immunohistochemistry is prepared on sections from block A2 with our finding the neoplastic cells are IDH1 R132H mutant protein negative and neoplastic cells from block B2 are GFAP positive (both spindled and epithelioid).  Reticulin stain (B2) highlights several reticulin-rich fibrovascular areas that are infiltrated by nests of  neoplastic cells.  A trichrome stain, also performed on part B, shows the nests of infiltrating cells are in collagen rich areas as well as numerous variably sized vessels with fibrous and muscular walls that have no significant pathology. CLINICAL HISTORY: Extracting from the electronic medical record we find Larraine Beal is a 55-year-old right handed female with 3 months of worsening headaches accompanied by nausea, vomiting and intermittent blurry vision.  Noncontrast CT of the head demonstrated a several centimeter right-sided temporoparietal mass with significant surrounding vasogenic edema. MRI showed a heterogenous enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe with evidence of increased perfusion and extensive, mostly non-enhancing, surrounding T2 FLAIR signal abnormality including into the corpus callosum. OPERATION: Right temporal craniotomy for tumor resection GROSS DESCRIPTION: Two specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""right temporal glioblastoma"" is received fresh in the operating room by a member of the Stanford Tissue Bank and consists a 6.0 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm portion of cerebral cortex with a smooth pia covering gyri on one surface and a rough surface opposite that.  Cutting the specimen into 4 pieces reveals cortical gray and white matter where gray matter is effaced in some areas as well as irregular heterogeneous soft bloody areas.  25% of the specimen is released to Stanford tissue bank.  After fixation, representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-A2 soft tissue fragments selected by Dr. Born A3-A6 additional representative sections  Aradillos (5/18/2015) The second specimen labeled ""dural base"" is received in formalin and consists of one dark brown fragment of tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm.

The gliosis includes microglia/macrophages and astrocytes.  Although there is no evidence for glioma in the samples, some of the individual atypical cells may in fact be neoplastic.  Further clinical correlation is suggested. MICROSCOPIC:  Multiple step level sections are examined for parts A to D and demonstrate mostly necrotic tissue with scattered areas of gliotic brain tissue.  In part D, there is a focus of mildly increased cellularity.  To better classify this area, immunohistochemical stains are performed, and the cellular area is negative for OLIG2 and positive for CD163.  P53 demonstrates rare positive cells. CLINICAL HISTORY: 58-year-old female with history of glioblastoma. Per patient's electronic medical record in EPIC, the patient is s/p resection of a glioblastoma on 5/18/2015, followed by XRT/TMZ, and Plerixafor clinical study.

BRAIN, LEFT OCCIPITAL LOBE TUMOR (SP13-4764; 9/25/13) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) ZISKIN/CLOETINGH/VOGEL/BORN COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation.  Dr. Ziskin discussed the case with Dr. Jyothsna on October 2, 2013. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate a proliferation of malignant and infiltrative cells characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by prominent microvascular proliferation and necrosis.  The provided immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplastic cells are positive for S100, a finding that can be seen in glioblastoma and malignant melanoma.  The melanoma specific markers MART-1 and HMB45 are negative in the neoplastic cells; an additional immunohistochemical stain for the melanoma marker MiTF performed in our laboratory is also negative in the neoplastic cells.  The provided immunohistochemical stain for GFAP is positive.  In our opinion, the histologic features including the infiltrative growth pattern and the immunohistochemical profile is diagnostic of glioblastoma.  Dr. Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are pending and will be reported in an addendum. CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year-old female with history of malignant melanoma of the left eye status post resection 15 years ago.  Now presents with a lesion in the left occipital lobe. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. DONALD BORN Electronically signed 10/8/2013 7:33 PM **ADDENDUM** ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to report the results of MGMT promoter methylation studies. ADDENDUM DESCRIPTION: MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR.  This specimen is negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene.  Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.  The diagnosis remains unchanged. DISCLAIMER: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (""CLIA"") as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A.

We have reviewed the patient's most recent right frontal brain biopsy (SHS-07-13359) and confirm the diagnosis of glioblastoma. Permanent sections of the tissue submitted for frozen section from the current case confirm the intraoperative diagnosis of infiltrating glioma. Permanent sections of the remainder of the resection specimen show an area of solid tumor (slide A5), which is hypercellular and contains large, angulated, hyperchromatic, mitotically active cells with pseudopalisading necrosis and vascular proliferation. The surrounding brain tissue shows necrosis and vascular changes consistent with radiation induced changes. In addition, there is bone dust and gel foam, consistent with the patient's history of prior surgery.

Specimen number one is labeled ""frontal tumor.""  Received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis are three pieces of pink-red soft tissue measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm, 0.3 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.  One-half of the specimen is frozen and not exhausted as FSA.  A small portion is also used for a squash preparation labeled TPA.  The frozen section residue is submitted as FSA1.  The remaining non-frozen tissue is submitted for flow cytometry. Specimen number two is labeled ""frontal tumor.""  The specimen consists of a mass of red-tan soft tissue measuring 6.2 x 6.2 x 3 cm.  The specimen was previously frozen; approximately one-quarter is submitted in formalin and the rest is submitted for tissue banking.  The specimen in formalin is serially sectioned to reveal soft, white, lobulated soft tissue and red soft tissue.  The specimen is entirely submitted in tissue paper in cassettes B1 - B7. Temmins for Neuropath/jt MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The intraoperative consultation slides are reviewed and we concur with the rendered diagnosis. The permanent H&E sections reveal a pleomorphic, biphasic neoplasm. The first component is characterized by a dense aggregate of neoplastic cells with enlarged hyperchromatic, irregular nuclei and a scant amount of cytoplasm.  Numerous apoptotic and mitotic figures are present.  The neoplastic nuclei show nuclear molding and rarely aggregate to form neurocytic rosettes.  A second component, which represents the vast majority of the neoplasm, is composed of a dense collection of gemistocytic astrocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed hyperchromatic, enlarged nuclei in a fibrillary background.  Occasional mitotic figures are seen. Pseudopalisading necrosis occupies a small portion of the submitted tissue (slide B2).  Microvascular proliferation is focally identified.  Immunohistochemical stains are performed to characterize the nature of the two cellular populations.  A vimentin immunostain is performed to confirm the immunoreactivity of the second specimen.  Stains of the first component demonstrate immunopositivity for synaptophysin; no immunoreactivity for GFAP, however, is present.  Focal immunoreactivity for myogenin, desmin and smooth muscle actin is found in this component as well.  The second component, however, shows strong GFAP immunopositivity but no immunoreactivity for synaptophysin.  Rare cells within this population also show focal reactivity for desmin and smooth muscle actin.  No CD99 immunoreactivity is found in the first component and INI-1 positivity is diffusely present.  The two populations of cells have markedly different Ki-67 labeling indices:  the first component has a labeling index of approximately 50%, while the second component has an index ranging between 2 and 10%.

A gate on larger cells identifies a CD45-negative population expressing bright CD56, but did not express other markers on our panel, including MPO, TdT, cytoplasmic light chains or CD38, cCD3, cCD79a or other hematolymphoid markers as listed above.  A few admixed probable monocytes are also present.  Gating on lymphocytes (strong CD45+, low FSC/SCC) shows a heterogeneous population of lymphoid cells with a predominance of T-cells and smaller numbers of B-cells and NK-cells. There is no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or abnormal T-cell population. No aberrant antigen expression is detected among lymphoid cells. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory .  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. FLOW COMMENT:  Flow cytometric analysis demonstrates a CD45-negative, CD38-negative, CD56+ large cell population, a finding which favors a non-hematolymphoid neoplasm.  The large, cohesive-appearing abnormal cell population on the cytocentrifuge prep is also consistent with these findings.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Eight slides labeled ""NS-5646-2005"" TPA (H & E and Dif-Qik stained), FSA-1 (2 total), FSA-2 (2 total), B-1 and B-2 are received. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The sections demonstrate a moderate to densely cellular neoplasm infiltrating primarily white matter.  In many areas the tumor cells have relatively rounded nuclei with mild irregularity of the nuclear outlines; small nucleoli are present in most cells.  In other areas a population of cells with eccentric eosinophilic cytoplasm of varying volume predominates.  These frankly gemistocytic cells are particularly nicely demonstrated in the H & E stained smear preparation.  There are several foci of vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.  Mitotic figures are readily identified. COMMENT:  While some areas of the neoplasm have an oligodendroglial phenotype, there is another population of cells with frankly gemistocytic features not typical of an oligodendroglioma. Accordingly, in consideration of the other histologic features, the diagnosis of glioblastoma is favored.  Thank you for sending this case in consultation.

MRI demonstrated a discrete enhancing mass in the left frontal lobe, as well as an indiscrete area, possibly enhancing, in the right parietal lobe.  Past medical history includes headaches and breast cancer (diagnosed 2001). GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received from Eden Hospital Medical Center are 15 slides and one block along with the corresponding surgical report.  Specimen A corresponds to the biopsy of the left frontal neoplasm for frozen section.  Specimen B corresponds to the frontal neoplasm for permanent section.  Specimen C is additionally labeled deep margin. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections from all three specimens and the squish preparation demonstrate similar features, and will be discussed together.  Sections demonstrate a proliferation of pleomorphic, hyperchromatic astrocytes with angular nuclei, set in a fibrillar background.  The lesional cells are GFAP positive.  A stain for synaptophysin highlights cortical neurons.  A stain for chromogranin is negative.  Several mitotic figures are identified, and a stain for Ki67 highlights 20-30% of cells.  There is evidence of focal vascular proliferation.  No necrosis is identified.   Some fields demonstrate perivascular tumor cell condensation, and consideration was given for a diagnosis of high-grade angiocentric glioma, however an immunohistochemical stain for EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) fails to highlight the neoplastic cells with characteristic perinuclear dot-like staining.  The neoplastic cells are seen infiltrating cortex, and are surround cortical neurons.  The neoplastic proliferation focally extends to the pial surface. PAS and PASD stains highlight the vascular proliferation, as well as corpora amylacea. COMMENT: Thank-you for sending us this case in consultation.  Sections demonstrate a cellular astrocytic proliferation with significantly increased mitotic activity and nuclear pleomorphism.  Some fields demonstrate vascular proliferation and, while no necrosis is identified, we believe this lesion is most compatible with a diagnosis of glioblastoma.

A representative fragment is used for a squash preparation as TPA.  Approximately one-third of the specimen is submitted for frozen section as FSA and not exhausted.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is submitted entirely in cassette FSA.  The non-frozen tissue is submitted entirely in cassette A1. The second specimen is received fresh from the operating room, stated to be ""left temporal brain tumor additional"" and consists of multiple fragments of gelatinous yellow and white soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm in aggregate.  Approximately one-third of the specimen is submitted for frozen section as FSB and not exhausted.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is submitted entirely in cassette FSB.  The non-frozen tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. The third specimen is received in formalin, stated to be ""left temporal brain tumor"" and consists of a fabric sack filled with pink-tan, soft tissue fragments measuring 6 x 5 x 2 cm in aggregate. Representative portions of the specimen are submitted in cassettes C1 - C5.    Dobo for Neuropath/amp MICROSCOPIC:  The permanent sections confirm the intraoperative frozen section and squash preparation diagnoses above.  The sections from the first specimen show gliotic brain tissue.  The absence of definite neoplasm in the frozen section is confirmed.  However, in the non-frozen tissue, rare bizarre cells with enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei are present amongst reactive brain tissue.  Additionally rare cells with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei are focally found.  No mitotic figures or vascular proliferation are identified in this specimen.  A rare small focus of necrosis is found. The sections from the second and third specimens show a glial neoplasm composed of cells with large, pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei.  Rare, scattered bizarre cells similar in appearance to those in the first specimen are found.  Mitotic activity is increased.  Vascular proliferation and geographic necrosis are present.  Pseudopalisading necrosis is not identified. There is sclerosis of the walls of several vessels in all specimens. COMMENT:  The large, bizarre cells in the specimens may be a consequence of the patient's prior treatment as they occur only as single cells, often amongst otherwise non-neoplastic parenchyma. The rare angulated cells with hyperchromatic nuclei in the first specimen may represent infiltrating neoplastic cells.  The current specimen was compared to this patient's prior resection specimen (SHS-06-06631).  Although the sections from the second and third specimens demonstrate a greater amount of atypia in some of the neoplastic cells, the morphologic features are similar overall.

BRAIN, RIGHT, BIOPSY (S19-008671; 07/04/2019) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH1 R132H WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE IV TOLAND/VOGEL COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting and challenging case in consultation. We agree with your diagnostic impression of a glioblastoma. The immunostains provided lend no support for a metastatic process and are consistent with the expected expression pattern of a glioblastoma. Dr. Angus Toland notified Dr. Pitman of the diagnosis on 7/12/19. Dr. Donald Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic sections show a proliferation of glial cells with marked nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. There are multiple foci demonstrating microvascular proliferation and pseudo-palisading necrosis. The provided immunohistochemical stains are also evaluated. The stain for Sox10 highlights scattered round, non-pleomorphic nuclei throughout likely representing oligodenroglia. The stain for Pan cytokeratin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) shows diffuse cytoplasmic expression in the neoplastic population. The stain for HMB-45 does not demonstrate expression within the tissue submitted. Immunohistochemical staining for IDH1 R132H mutation is performed on block ""B1"" at the request of Dr. Pitman. Staining demonstrates no positive cells within the tissue section, consistent with an IDH1 R132H wild-type tumor. CLINICAL HISTORY:  71-year-old man who presents with multiple mass lesions. The patient has a previous history of metastatic melanoma. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Pathology materials labeled as case number S19-008671 (6 slides, 2 blocks labeled S19-008671) are received from Shasta Pathology Associates on behalf of Dr. Blankenberg.

DIAGNOSIS: BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL LESION, BIOPSIES (YS-13-0007916 A1, B1; 12/11/2013) --   INFLAMMATORY PROCESS (SEE COMMENT) ZISKIN/VOGEL/PLOWEY COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this challenging case in consultation.  The biopsy shows an inflammatory process composed of T cells in a predominantly perivascular distribution.  While the findings may represent a reactive process, we cannot rule out the possibility of an atypical T cell infiltrate that could be seen in the setting of CNS T cell lymphoma.  We do not have access to the radiology for radiologic-pathologic correlation; clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended to determine if the biopsy is representative of the targeted lesion.  Consideration for open biopsy for definitive diagnosis is recommended if the lesion progresses or if otherwise clinically indicated.  Dr. Ziskin left a message regarding the case for Dr. Flanagan on December 19, 2013. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate small fragments of mildly hypercellular subcortical white matter with focal perivascular inflammatory infiltrates.  There is accentuation of individual axons and disruption of the white matter architecture by scattered infiltrating cells with mildly increased nuclear size. A couple of vessels show increased perivascular cellularity. An immunohistochemical stain for CD20 reveals rare CD20 positive B cells. A CD3 stain suggests that T-cells contribute to the increased cellularity and shows that the perivascular cells are predominantly composed of T cells.  An immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 predominantly highlights the perivascular cells but also labels scattered cells in the parenchyma.  The distribution of the CD3 positive cells is similar to the Ki-67 positive cells.  An immunohistochemical stain for CD30 is negative showing no evidence of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.  Immunohistochemical stains for beta and gamma t-cell receptors shows a predominance of beta positive cells with rare gamma positive cells, revealing no evidence for a clonal gamma delta receptor positive T cell process. An immunohistochemical stain for the IDH1 R132H mutation (clone H09) is negative, providing no evidence for an underlying low grade glioma. CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year-old male with clustered cortically based enhancing foci within the superomedial left parietal lobe.  No significant mass effect is seen.

DIAGNOSIS: BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL, BIOPSIES (YS-14-0740; 2/5/2014) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) ZISKIN/VOGEL/BORN COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation.  We agree that the findings are those of a high grade glioma and most compatible with glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  We also considered the possibility of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplasia, however we favor glioblastoma due to the absence of eosinophilic granular bodies and absence of BRAF V600E mutation. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity (enumerated at up to 13 per 10 high power fields), and variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by intense mixed inflammation including plasma cells, lymphocytes and histiocytes.  The malignant cells show variable morphologic features including areas with predominance of gemistocytic morphology, foamy cells, spindle cells, and scattered bizarre pleomorphic nuclei that raise consideration for pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplasia.  Assessment for vascular proliferation is challenging due to the presence of dense perivascular inflammation, however level sections performed on the blocks reveals one focus of definitive microvascular proliferation (C1).  Many foci suggestive of necrosis are seen at specimen edges however unequivocal necrosis is not identified.  An immunohistochemical stain for GFAP shows variable weak to strong cytoplasmic staining of the neoplastic cells.   Molecular studies to evaluate for the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation are negative. CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year-old female with recent biopsies of left parietal brain mass.

We have examined the submitted slides and entirely agree with your diagnostic observations. The provided histologic sections reveal an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with variable morphologies. The tumor cells are often seen with more typical astrocytoid cytomorphology, e.g. coarse chromatin, ameboid nuclear contours and variable cytoplasm, however we also find area where tumor cells take on a more embryonal appearance with more dense and hyperchromatic chromatin and a relative monotony of nuclear profile and reduction in cell size. In the latter areas the tumor cells are seen arranged in nests and perivascular arrays. Additionally we find numerous cytologically abnormal ganglion cells intimately associated with these malignant glia, specifically in the more astrocytoid regions, as well as scattered neoplastic giant cells.  Tumor mitotic activity is increased. Microvascular proliferation and necrosis are readily discerned. Immunohistochemical stains performed at Stanford on recuts of the provided block show variable tumor nuclear staining for p53; we note that the giant cells described above are preferntially labeled. MAP-2 tags the abnormal ganglion cells. It also demonstrates diffuse positivity in the tumor population with a more small-cell cytology, and some patchy positivity in the more astrocytoid population. The findings are most consistent with a malignant glioma with both giant cell and neuronal differentiation. The cited reference (see below) is another instance of such a tumor found in the literature. Dr. Peyman Samghabadi communicated the final diagnosis to Dr. Stephen M. Avalos on 3/24/16. Dr. Donald Born has reviewed the case and agrees with our diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the provided materials, the patient is an 83 year old female with a right frontal lobe tumor. On MRI the lesion has an ill-defined margin, central necrosis and abnormal enhancement.

We agree with the interpretation of a hypercellular astrocytic lesion. The morphologic and immunohistochemical profiles most support a diagnosis of glioblastoma and likely represent a small cell variant. Dr. Ozawa discussed the case with Dr. Arroyo on 2/4/13 at 9:00 am.      The lesion is negative for MGMT promoter methylation. The presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. MICROSCOPIC: The provided sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by closely packed cells with small, mildly hyperchromatic nuclei, nuclear molding, and minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background.  Marked microvascular proliferation, frequent mitotic figures, and necrosis are identified.  Additional immunohistochemical stain performed at Stanford for IDH-1 is negative.

The diagnosis remains unchanged. ____________________________________________________________________ ________________ Specimen source: SHS-12-10491, outside 12S-2364 2 , 60% tumor Clinical indication:  Predict response to alkylating agents. Result:  POSITIVE Comment Positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Interpretation: This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. Method: (NOTE) MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. Disclaimer: (NOTE) DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Specimen one additionally designated ""subtotal pancreatectomy, splenectomy with margin"" consists of a segment of distal pancreas with an attached encapsulated mass measuring 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm.  The mass does not grossly appear to have invaded the pancreas.  There is a segment of pancreas measuring 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm attached to the mass and at the pole of the pancreas opposite the mass there is a spleen measuring 11 x 5.4 x 4 cm.  There is a segment of fat attached to the combined pancreas and spleen specimen measuring 15 x 17 x 2 cm. There is a segment of pancreas extending 1 cm past the mass.  A portion of this marked with a stitch and described by the surgeon as the true pancreatic margin is removed and consists of red-tan, firm tissue measuring 0.2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm.  This fragment is submitted for intraoperative diagnosis, is not exhausted, and is submitted for permanent sections as FSA.  The specimen is opened to reveal an encapsulated mass containing firm, yellow, homogeneous tissue with occasional red streaks.  The specimen is submitted as follows:  A1: representative sections of tumor; A2 through A4: tumor and pancreas; A5: pancreas near mass; A6: two representative sections of spleen; A7: spleen; A8 through A9: candidate lymph node aggregates; A10: additional pancreatic tumor. Specimen two additionally designated ""gallbladder"" consists of a pink-gray gallbladder, which has been previously opened and measures 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.  The interior has brown-red, velvety mucosa with orange foci of cholesterolosis.  The wall thickness is 0.3 cm and the cystic duct measures 0.4 cm in diameter with a wall thickness of 0.2 cm.  In addition, a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm yellow, smooth stone is identified.  Representative sections are submitted in B1. Howell/jt COMMENT:  We have reviewed the prior case (SHF 03-903) and confirm the diagnosis of a spindle cell neoplasm.  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and permanent slides made from the non-frozen material and confirm the diagnosis of no tumor seen in the pancreatic margin.  Histologic sections show a spindle cell neoplasm with ellipsoid nuclei with granular chromatin.  The cells are arranged in randomly interwoven fascicles surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes and a fibrous capsule.  Immunoperoxidase studies (IDX# 03-3282) performed on sections of the mass show positive staining for S100 and negative staining for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and c-kit (CD-117).  The immunophenotypic profile and the histologic features support a diagnosis of schwannoma.  The mass is tangentially connected to the pancreas and does not show invasion.

Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm characterized by marked nuclear anaplasia, mitotic activity and complex vessels with microvascular proliferation.  No definitive necrosis is seen.  Immunostains performed at The Permanente Medical Group demonstrate the following results: a GFAP immunostain highlights fibrillary astrocytic tumor processes and is negative in the proliferative microvasculature and a Ki67 immunostain demonstrates a proliferative index of approximately 10-15%.  The tumor is negative for the following immunostains: IDH1 and Melan A.  An AE1/AE3 cytokeratin cocktail immunostain shows light cross reactivity in some of the glioma cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Received from Dr. John Morrow from The Permanente Medical Group (Redwood City, California) are 3 H&E slides and 6 immunostains (AE1/AE3, GFAP, IDH1, IDH1 positive control, Melan A, and Ki-67) from patient Mark Ojeda (RWCS13-5824; 6/13/2013), a 52 year-old man who had a stereotactic core biopsy of an enhancing intra axial occipital lesion.  According to the outside MRI report, there is an ill-defined infiltrative enhancement along the inferior parasagittal left occipital lobe with surrounding edema and enhancement of the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle, with ill-defined non-enhancing infiltrative/masslike areas of T2 prolongation in the left thalamus and left perisylvian region. Radiologically, the findings favor high-grade glial neoplasm with subependyomal spread into the left lateral ventricle, and associated areas of non-enhancing multifocal gliomatosis involving the anterior temporal lobe.

Both the epithelioid glioblastoma and the PXA components of this tumor resection are positive for the BRAF V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry. MGMT promoter methylation testing is in progress and the results will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Donald Born has also reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. Dr. Plowey informed Dr. Gordon Li of the diagnosis by email on November 18, 2016 at 9:30 AM. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the prior consult case (SHS-16-45608) and agree with the diagnosis of PXA with focal anaplasia. Histologic sections from Parts A, B and C of the current case demonstrate abundant residual PXA as well as frequent areas with discohesive epithelioid cells with brisk mitotic activity and necrosis. The epithelioid cells have only very focal reactivity for GFAP (predominantly negative) whereas GFAP immunoreactivity is strongly positive in the PXA component. Both the epithelioid glioblastoma and PXA are positive for the BRAF V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry. The epithelioid tumor cells show foci of reactivity for CD31 and ERG that is of uncertain significance, however, most of the epithelioid cells are negative for these endothelial markers. CD34 is positive in the PXA component but negative in the epithelioid cells. The epithelioid cells also show lack of INI1 in the nucleus but strong staining in the cytoplasm, a finding of uncertain significance but not interpreted to be related to AT/RT. INI1 immunoreactivity is present in the nuclei of the PXA component. The tumor cells are negative for melanoma markers HMB45, MelanA and MiTF.

Based on the histologic features and molecular study results, the diagnosis changed from High-grade glioma, IDH1 R132H-mutant to Glioblastoma, IDH R132H-mutant, WHO grade 4. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the slides generated during intraoperative analysis (Part A) and we agree with the diagnoses rendered at that time. The features are those of a high-grade glioma and are likely compatible with a secondary glioblastoma. The Foundation One CDx panel is ordered and results with further characterization of this tumor will follow in an amended report. Dr. Donald Born viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections show a proliferation of markedly atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, frequent multinucleated cells, and a loose myxoid background. Numerous mitotic figures are present. There are regions of tumor necrosis and multiple foci of microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining for IDH1 R132H shows strong diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells, indicating mutant status. Staining for H3 K27me3 shows loss of expression in a subset of cells.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL, BIOPSY --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH R132H WILD-TYPE, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) PARK/CAYROL/BORN COMMENT:  We reviewed the smear prep slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis.  MGMT promoter methylation by PCR testing is initiated and results will be reported as an addendum. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate small tissue fragments composed of a variably cellular neoplasm where the cells are moderately pleomorphic due to nuclear hyperchromasia, coarse chromatin, and irregular nuclear membranes.  The neoplastic cells are seen to infiltrate within cortical gray matter where there are some examples of satellitosis.  There are prominent areas of necrosis with thrombosed vessels and focally prominent microvascular proliferation.  An IDH immunohistochemistry on sections from block A1 is negative (wildtype). CLINICAL HISTORY: 60-year-old male with brain tumor.  In the electronic medical record, Epic, we find Javier Ayala has two tumors on imaging, one left temporal and one left internal auditory canal (IAC).  The left temporal tumor is a 4.1 x 5 cm infiltrative, heterogeneously enhancing lesion mass with associated adjacent T2 signal abnormality extending into the left parietal lobe and centrum ovale and significant mass effect including extension into the atrium of the left lateral ventricular, where there is possible ependymal spread.  The imaging features favor glioblastoma multiforme.  The second tumor is an 8 x 13 mm enhancing lesion within an expanded left IAC, most consistent with a schwannoma.

Molecular testing by NGS at Foundation Medicine has been ordered and results will be reported in an addendum, and MGMT promoter methylation assay has been ordered and the results will be reported in Epic. Dr. Cobos has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis rendered. Histologic sections show a proliferation of glial cells with prominent nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. Some regions demonstrate cells with epithelioid to gemistocytic morphology whereas others show a more spindled appearance. Necrosis and mitotic figures are present. Immunohistochemical stains performed on block B2 show patchy positive staining for GFAP, and weak patchy staining for EGFR. Reticulin stain highlights microvascular proliferation. IDH1 is negative (wild-type) and BRAF V600E is negative. ATRX is conserved (non-mutated) and p53 demonstrates patchy positivity with a predilection for larger nuclei.

The first specimen is designated ""brain biopsy, FS"" and is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis.  It consists of multiple fragments of tan tissue, measuring 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm in loose aggregate.  A portion of the tissue is designated FS1 and is frozen but not exhausted.  The remaining tissue is now submitted in toto in cassette FS1.  The unfrozen portion of tissue is designated X1 and is submitted in toto in cassette X1. The second specimen is designated ""brain tumor"" and is received in formalin.  It consists of multiple fragments of tan tissue, measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm in loose aggregate.  The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in cassette A1. The third specimen is designated ""brain biopsy FS"" and is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis.  It consists of multiple fragments of tan tissue, measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm in loose aggregate.  A portion of the tissue is designated FS2 and frozen but not exhausted.  The remaining tissue is now submitted in toto in cassette FS2.  The unfrozen portion of tissue is designated X2 and is submitted in toto in cassette X2. Fenn/crh MICROSCOPIC: The permanent sections of FS1 and FS2 are consistent with the frozen section diagnoses. Radiation induced changes including vascular thickening, reactive astrocytosis and mild edema are present. No definite tumor focus is seen in any of the sections.  Rare atypical cells are present, showing enlarged, irregular nuclei.  Occasional gemistocytic astrocytes and satellitosis are noted. Mitoses and definite necrosis are not seen. COMMENT: This case was presented at the Monday neuropathology conference, and the pathologists in attendance were in agreement that it represents a difficult diagnostic dilemma. Radiation therapy induced changes are present. Whether the atypical cells noted above also represent radiation induced change or residual tumor cells cannot be determined with certainty, however, they are somewhat suspicious for tumor.  This biopsy may not be representative of the radiographically apparent lesion, and may be from the edge of the lesion.

Unlike the previous specimen which showed features of a microcellular variant of glioblastoma multiforme, the present specimen shows tumor cells with mostly round nuclei and hydropic cytoplasm, raising the possibility that the glioblastoma multiforme originated from an oligodendroglioma.  However, it is not certain whether these histologic features truly represent the neoplasm, or whether they may be due to an artifact of the CUSA procedure. I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. DIKRAN HOROUPIAN M.D. Pathologist Electronically Signed 12/07/1999   ACCESSION NUMBER: SHS-99-33240"

FS2:      --   GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME. (EH/HK/RAS) GROSS DESCRIPTION: The first specimen is received fresh from the Operating Room and consists of one fragment of soft tan tissue measuring 0.5 cm in maximum dimension.  A portion is frozen as FS 1A, and the remainder is frozen as FS 1B.  Both specimens are subsequently submitted for permanent sectioning in cassettes labeled FS 1A and FS 1B, respectively. The second specimen is received fresh from the Operating Room, designated ""superficial"" and consists of one fragment of soft tan-red tissue measuring 0.3 cm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is frozen in its entirety as FS2 and subsequently submitted for permanent sectioning in a cassette labeled FS2. The third part of the specimen is received in a plastic container labeled with the patient's name and number and designated ""glioblastoma"".  The specimen is in formalin and consists of an irregular fragment of soft tan red tissue measuring 4.5 x 4.2 x 2.7 cm.  Upon sectioning the tissue has a heterogenous appearance with focal hemorrhagic areas and focal mucoid areas.  Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled A1-A5. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections of FS1A and FS1B confirm the frozen section diagnosis of necrotic tissue. Sections show necrosis with areas suggestive of neovascularization.  Viable cells are not identified and although the identified features are included with those of glioblastoma multiforme, this diagnosis could not be made on these features alone.      Permanent sections of FS2 confirm the frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  Sections show predominantly necrotic tissue with outlying viable tumor cells.  The tumor has a variegated microscopic appearance.  In some areas where the tumor is seen infiltrating reactive brain tissue.  In section A5, the tumor consists of compact, solid sheets of cells that maintain round-appearing nuclei. Other areas are more astrocytic in appearance with loosely arranged cells that show marked pleomorphism and anaplasia.  These cells have definite astroglial features including prominent cytoplasmic processes and more eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The vast majority (approximately 90%) of the sample is necrotic and many areas of neovascularization are seen. Additionally, mitotic figures are readily identified and atypical mitoses are seen on a smear preparation.

The entire specimen is submitted in three cassettes H1-H3.  Temmins/vb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The permanent sections of the frozen tissue have been reviewed and the above intraoperative diagnosis confirmed.  All of the submitted specimens demonstrate similar microscopic features and will be described together.  The sections demonstrate a neoplasm, which infiltrates dense connective tissue, skeletal muscle, bone and adipose tissue.  The neoplasm has two predominant growth patterns: adenoid and spindled.  The adenoid areas consist of aggregates of neoplastic cells in epithelioid arrangements.  These areas merged with spindled neoplastic cells often in a myxoid-rich background. The degree of nuclear pleomorphism is relatively mild.  Nucleoli are prominent in some of the adenoid areas.  Mitotic figures are readily found.  To clarify the nature of the neoplastic population, immunostains for calponin, muscle specific actin, p63, pankeratin, desmin, myogenin, epithelial membrane antigen, S-100 and GFAP were performed.  The tumor cells demonstrated uniform and strong immunopositivity for S-100 and GFAP only. The previous surgical specimen (SHS-04-17648) is reviewed.  We concur with the previous diagnosis and further note the absence of adenoid and spindled growth patterns in that specimen.

The core roll preparations are mildly cellular and show rare clusters of atypical cells with mildly enlarged nuclei and moderate amounts of vacuolated cytoplasm.  Other clusters of cells with round and abundant amounts of granular cytoplasm are also present.  The core biopsy is scant but shows fragments of tissue with normal kidney elements including tubules and glomeruli.  There is a single minute fragment of tissue with mildly atypical cells with clear vacuolated cytoplasm.  An immunohistochemical stain shows that the atypical cells express PAX 8. While the findings are worrisome for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the paucicellular nature of the specimen precludes definitive diagnosis.

Sundram/ck MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  Sections of the temporal lobe lesion demonstrate a highly cellular glial tumor which is composed of pleomorphic cells with marked nuclear atypia and a brisk mitotic rate.  Large areas of necrosis, prominent vascular proliferation, and neovascularization are present.  Many tumor cells display some features of oligodendroglia especially round hyperchromatic nuclei. COMMENT: The findings are consistent with glioblastoma multiforme.  However, the presence of prominent oligodendroglial features suggests that the progenitor cells may have been oligodendroglial. Glioblastoma multiforme with oligodendroglial features may respond more favorably to PCV therapy and/or have generally a slightly better prognosis than classic glioblastomas.

DIKRAN HOROUPIAN M.D. Pathologist Electronically signed 11/29/2000 ******ADDENDUM****** The purpose of this addendum is to report the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) analysis of this patient's tumor.  Representative sections of the patient's tumor were sent to Dr. Arie Perry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis for a second opinion and FISH analysis for 19q and 1p deletions.  Dr. Perry essentially concurs with our diagnosis of glioblastoma, although he felt that in the regions that we thought showed oligodendroglial differentiation, he felt these areas with uniform appearing nuclei were more consistent with small cell astrocytic features and thus more likely the small cell variant of glioblastoma.   As research tool FISH was performed.  No 1p and 19q deletions were identified.   Instead, evidence of EGFR gene amplification was found.  According to a recent study reported by Peter Burger and colleagues, approximately 70% of small cell glioblastoma display EGFR gene amplification.  The patient's two-year survival is interesting and may be related to the young age or favorable therapy in general.  The original diagnosis remains unchanged.  The report from Barnes-Jewish Hospital Washington University Medical Center is as follows: DIAGNOSIS BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY (SHS00-33030) GLIOBLASTOMA WITH SMALL CELL FEATURES, WHO GRADE IV (OF IV) MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT A representative section reveals a highly cellular infiltrative glial neoplasm with large zones of geographic necrosis and associated nuclear pseudopalisading.  The predominant histology is that of moderately atypical cells with oval nuclei, minimal cytoplasm and coarse chromatin.  In some areas, this is associated with a rich branching capillary network, imparting the appearance of ""chicken wire"".  The mitotic index is brisk and there is endothelial hyperplasia.  Although the nuclear uniformity in some regions suggests the possibility of oligodendroglial differentiation, classic oligodendroglial features are not identified.  The morphologic features are most consistent with a glioblastoma with small cell features, WHO grade IV. Recent clinical studies have suggested that the combined loss of chromosome 1p and 19 q in oligodendroglial neoplasms is associated with prolonged survival and increased sensitivity for ""PCV"" chemotherapy (Refs. 1-4).  As a research tool, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue with human RPCI-11 BAC library derived probes (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) localizing to 1p32, 1p42, 19p13 and 19q13.  In this particular case, there were polysomies (i.e., gains) of both chromosomes 1 and 19.  No deletions were identified.   Additional FISH studies were performed utilizing CEP& and EGFR probes.  There was evidence for EGFR gene amplification in >90% of tumor cells. Although not entirely specific, this genetic pattern supports the above-cited diagnosis of glioblastoma with small cell features. EGFR gene amplifications have been reported in approximately 70% of small cell glioblastomas. It should be stressed that the associations between genetic phenotype and clinical behavior have not been absolute and at present, the data should be considered preliminary and experimental.

The provided H&E-stained sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, foci of increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by rare foci of microvascular proliferation.  The provided immunohistochemical stain for GFAP is diffusely positive, compatible with malignant glioma and the immunohistochemical stain for S100 is weak but shows some staining that also supports glial differentiation.  The immunohistochemical for MIB-1 confirms the histologic impression of a highly proliferative neoplasm.  The CD45 stain shows no evidence for lymphoma.  In our opinion, the features are those of a high-grade glioma and the presence of microvascular proliferation is sufficient for classification as glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV.

SMALL BOWEL AND CECUM CLINICAL HISTORY: Small bowel obstruction. OPERATION: Exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Not given. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Not given. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh from the operating room, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number, designated ""small bowel and cecum.""  It consists of a length of small bowel with attached cecum and intact appendix.  The cecum and small bowel are opened along the anti-mesenteric border.  The portion of cecum measures 7.0 x 4.5 x 0.1 cm (in wall thickness) and appears partially cystic and thin-walled.  The appendix measures 4.5 cm in length and has an external circumference of 0.6 cm and appears grossly normal.  The small bowel measures 37.5 cm in length and has a variable diameter and wall thickness.  The proximal 11.5 cm has an internal diameter of 4.5 cm and a wall thickness of 0.3 to 0.5 cm. There are numerous constrictions which will be described later.  The adjoining (more distal) 8.0 cm of small bowel is dilated with an internal diameter of 19.0 cm.  The thickness of the wall of small bowel in this region is 0.6 to 0.7 cm.  The distal 7.0 cm of small bowel has a 5.0 cm internal diameter and a 0.4 cm wall thickness. There are six concentric constrictions present along the length of the small bowel located 5.5 cm, 9.0 cm, 13.5 cm, 8.5 cm, 22.0 cm and 22.9 cm from the proximal end.  There are a variety of polypoid lesions located at the sites of constriction and these will be described as they are submitted for histologic sectioning.  Note that the most dilated region of small bowel (8.0 cm segments) is nearly devoid of mucosal folds, and has a smooth tan-pink surface. In other regions of small bowel the folds appear thickened and widened.  The specimen is fixed overnight in formalin before further sectioning. The specimen is sampled as follows:  proximal resection margin, cassette A1, distal resection margin, cassette A2.  The grossly normal appendix is amputated and submitted as usual in cassette A3. A longitudinal section through the ileocecal valve area is submitted in cassette A4.  There are two raised areas in the vicinity of the valve; one measures 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.  The other is larger, measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm.  A cross-section through this area is submitted in cassette A4.  A parallel section is submitted in cassette A5, through the entire thickness of bowel wall, including an area of either nodule in the mesentery or in the bowel wall.  In this particular area, the apparent cross-section of the bowel wall measures 0.8 cm.  The remainder of terminal ileum wall (distal 7.0 cm) measures 0.4 cm.  Representative sections of more normal-appearing (distal 7.0 cm) terminal ileum are submitted in cassette A6.  In the region of the most distal constriction, four elevated, red lesions are present, ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm.  There is also a polypoid mass (tan-white in color) which measures 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Longitudinal section including a hemorrhagic area as well as the polyp is submitted in cassette A7. Representative sections of the dilated area of terminal ileum (without mucosal folds) are submitted in cassette A8.  This is also a longitudinal section.  In the region of the second most distal constriction, a larger area of erythema is present, with some areas raised in a manner similar to the previously described polyp. Representative sections through this area are submitted in cassette A9.  The area of erythema measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm (this area is located 22.0 cm from the proximal end of the specimen). At the constriction located 18.5 cm from the proximal end of the specimen, there is a raised polyp measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm.  The complete circumference is erythematous.  A partially circumferential section, including the polyp is sampled in cassette A11.  There is also a hemorrhagic raised polyp, 3.0 cm proximal to the previously described area, which measures 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 mm.  This polyp does not correspond to constriction, and is sampled in cassette A12, along relatively unremarkable small bowel.  The small bowel wall is somewhat gelatinous on cut section in this area. There is an area of hemorrhage, but no noted polyps at the area of constriction located 13.5 cm from the proximal end of the specimen; there is also an area of ulceration.  This region is submitted in cassette A13.  Similar, somewhat ulcerated areas are located adjacent to but not coincident with the other areas of concentric constriction.  They measure in size (both the same) approximately 1.1 x 0.5 cm.  These regions are both sampled in cassette A14. Longitudinal samples of small bowel located between the proximal end of the specimen and the first constriction, as well as between the first and second constriction (most proximal constriction) are sampled in cassette A15.  Further samples of small bowel at 15.0 cm and 22.0 cm, along with a sample at approximately 35.0 cm are submitted in cassette A16.  Cassette number A10 was not used in submitting sections. The root of the mesentery was dissected from the small bowel prior to fixation, and is nodular to palpation. Dissection reveals multiple candidate lymph nodes, ranging in size from 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm to 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.  Each lymph node is sectioned in order to fit into a cassette, and are submitted in cassettes B1-B9; one lymph node per cassette, nine lymph nodes in all.  The mesentery still attached to the terminal ileum is serially sectioned revealing no additional lymph nodes.

The patient has one prior GI pathologic specimen which was found to be consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (SHS-92-02428). The current specimen exhibits several features consistent with of chronic inflammatory bowel disease,  including a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, submucosal edema, mucosal thickening, architectural distortion of glands, and granulomata both within the bowel wall as well as within numerous sampled lymph nodes.  AFB and GMS stains are negative for organisms.  Polyps noted grossly are inflammatory in nature.  The appendix is obliterated by fibrosis.

HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 8/29/2013 5:18 PM **ADDENDUM** ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to report the results of MGMT promoter methylation studies. ADDENDUM DESCRIPTION: MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR.  This specimen is positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents.  The diagnosis remains unchanged. DISCLAIMER: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

The previous resection could not be reviewed as the slides have been sent back to the contributor (SHS-16-31336). Although IDH1 R132H immunohistochemistry was negative (no evidence for mutation) there may be an alternative IDH1 mutation or an IDH2 mutation.  Molecular testing for possible IDH1 and IDH2 will be investigated by STAMP (Solid Tumor Actionable Mutation Panel) and the results will be reported in EPIC and in an amendment. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show an astrocytic proliferation of round to elongated, hyperchromatic nuclei with mitoses in a fibrillary background. Pseudo-palisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are noted. Immunohistochemistry performed at Stanford demonstrates that the neoplastic cells express ATRX (non-mutated) while IDH1 R132H and p53 are negative (wildtype).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received in consultation, courtesy of Dr. Quinn of Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz California, are 2 H&E stained sections and a cytologic preparation (S09 - 560) MICROSCOPIC:  Both the cytologic preparation and permanent sections demonstrate similar features and will be discussed together.  These sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei.  Mitotic figures are frequently identified.  Prominent microvascular proliferation is present.  A subset of the tumor cells demonstrates predominantly round nuclei and perinuclear clearings, suggestive of oligodendroglial differentiation.

Three paraffin tissue blocks labeled S06-018239 1, 2 and 3 are also received as well as the pathology report from the outside institution. MICROSCOPIC:  The sections show fragments of gray and white matter with reactive astrogliosis.  Numerous microglia are noted throughout the specimen.  Slide 1 shows scattered astrocytes with large, atypical nuclei and vesicular chromatin.  These atypical cells are not present in other sections.  Rare mitotic figures are also identified.  No necrosis or vascular proliferation is present.  No inflammation is identified.  Immunohistochemical stains for SV40 and HSV are negative.  Ki-67 shows a proliferative fraction of <1%.

The non-frozen portion of the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette A2.   Dobo for Neuropath/ch MICROSCOPIC:  The permanent sections confirm the intraoperative frozen section and squash preparation diagnosis.  The sections show a moderately cellular glial neoplasm with a fibrillar background. The neoplastic cells have large, hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular nuclear contours.  There is a patchy infiltrate of foamy macrophages and small lymphocytes.  Microvascular proliferation is seen focally, but no areas of necrosis are found.  A few scattered mitotic figures are identified.  To clarify the nature of the process, immunohistochemical stains for CD3, CD20, CD163, Ki-67 and SV40 are performed.  There are occasional CD3 immunoreactive T-cells and rare CD20 immunoreactive B-cells scattered throughout the neoplasm.  There are numerous CD163 immunoreactive cells within the lesion; however none of the highly atypical cells are CD163 reactive.  The Ki-67 labeling index is 10-15% in the most proliferative areas.  No SV40 immunoreactivity is found.  LFB and Bielschowsky stains show a patchy loss of myelin and axons in the regions of dense macrophage infiltration. COMMENT:  The current specimen is compared to this patient's prior specimen (SHS-07-1647).  The atypical cells in the prior specimen most likely represent high grade neoplastic astrocytes.

BRAIN TUMOR B. BRAIN TUMOR C. DEEP NECROTIC TUMOR CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left parietal glioblastoma multiforme.  Per the Notes in CareCast, this 42 year old man presented with hand and eye coordination difficulties and subsequently developed a severe headache with nausea and vomiting.  He presented to an outside emergency room, at which time CT imaging revealed a very large lesion in his left parietal lobe.  MR imaging shows a large heterogenous mass within the left parietal lobe causing midline shift and extending into the posterior corpus callosum.  There is surrounding vasogenic edema effacing the adjacent lateral ventricle.  A recent stereotactic biopsy showed glioblastoma (SHS-08-10479; 3/19/08). OPERATION:  Craniotomy for tumor resection. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Three containers are received all labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Specimen A designated ""brain tumor"" consists of a 5 x 5 x 1 cm aggregate of soft, tan-red tissue.  Approximately 70% of the specimen is harvested by tissue bank including three Eppendorf tubes containing snap frozen tissue.  The remainder of the tissue is submitted in A1 and A2. Specimen B designated ""brain tumor"" consists of two tan-red tissue portions aggregating 7 x 5 x 1.5 cm.  Approximately 80% of the specimen is harvested by the tissue bank.  The remainder of the specimen is submitted in B1-B3. Specimen C designated ""necrotic tumor"" consists of three tan-red tissue fragments aggregating 2.6 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm.  The specimen is entirely submitted in C1.   Rapuano for Neuropath/mkb MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the prior pathology from the stereotactic biopsy and confirm the diagnosis of glioblastoma (SHS-08-10479; 3/19/08).  Histologic sections of the current resection specimens have similar morphology and will be described together.  Sections show hypercellular white matter involved by a diffuse proliferation of malignant cells characterized by enlarged, predominately round nuclei with perinuclear halos and variable membrane irregularities set in a fibrillary background.  Admixed malignant cells with atypical, angulated nuclei are also present. There are scattered areas of pseudopallisading and geographic necrosis and microvascular proliferation.  Mitotic figures are frequent.  Adjacent cortical gray matter appears to be uninvolved by the neoplasm. COMMENT:  The morphologic features are those of glioblastoma with oligodendroglial features (predominately round nuclei and perinuclear halos).  Given the oligodendroglial features, FISH studies for 1p/19q deletion have been ordered and will be reported in an addendum.

This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis.  The diagnosis is unchanged. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two dual-color probe sets (Vysis) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Two hundred cells were scored for each probe set.  Abnormal 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns were observed in 9.5% and 7.0% of analyzed cells, respectively.  Normal 1p36 and the 19q13 signal patterns were observed in 9.0% and 9.0% of nuclei, respectively.  Complex 1p36 and the 19q13 signal patterns polyploidy signals without deletion were observed in 64% and 70% of nuclei, respectively.  The remaining nuclei demonstrated low level variable patterns consistent with aneuploidy without relative deletion and/or sectioning error or hybridization inefficiency. The observed levels of deletion signal pattern are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections.  A complex and heterogeneous population of cells consistent with polysomies of chromosomes #1 and #19 is detected. The diagnostic/prognostic significance of this finding is unknown. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

We agree with the interpretation of glioblastoma.  Dr. Salmi provided preliminary results to Dr. Thorne on 3/30/12 at 8:10am.  MGMT promoter methylation testing can be performed upon request. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate an astrocytic neoplasm with cellular anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, pseudopalisading necrosis and endothelial hyperplasia.  Subpial tumor spread is seen on Slide B6.  A GFAP immunostain performed at Intermountain highlights astrocytic processes in tumor cells.  Several regions show a subpopulation with small cell undifferentiated morphology. Immunohistochemical staining for EGFR on the outside block (UVS-12-005948 B4) is moderate and diffuse in the tumor.  Tumor cell labeling in most areas is not significantly more intense than in cortical astrocytes.  This immunohistochemical result is not suggestive of EGFR amplification, however, FISH analysis would be a more sensitive test for EGFR amplification. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per provided report, the patient is a 67 year old male who presented to the ER with memory loss, confusion, and incontinence for 3 weeks. He complained of headaches but reported no seizures. An MRI showed a left frontal tumor with the appearance of an intrinsic tumor such as glioma. He underwent craniotomy for debulking on 3/27/12.

Thank you for sending us this interesting and challenging case in consultation.  Dr. Brock Martin discussed a preliminary diagnosis favoring glioblastoma with Dr. Honda by telephone at 12:00 on 5/31/2012.  The accompanying imaging studies were reviewed the Dr. Nancy Fischbein, Neuroradiologist at Stanford. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E stained slides reveal a cellular neoplasm comprised of moderately pleomorphic spindle cells with fine to blunt/ropy fibrillar astrocytic processes.  Mitotic activity and pseudopalisading necrosis are identified.  The tumor cells are strongly positive with a GFAP immunostain which highlights the fibrillary astrocytic processes.  The tumor is positive for S100 but negative for EMA.  An EGFR immunostain performed at Stanford to confirm the astrocytic nature of the neoplastic cells is diffusely and lightly positive (expected negative in schwannoma).  A reticulin stain performed at Stanford is also inconsistent with the extensive reticulin deposition expected for Schwannoma. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with a 2.2 cm mass at the cerebellopontine angle.

Numerous scattered mitotic figures are identified. Multiple foci of microvascular proliferation are present as well as regions of necrosis. The provided immunohistochemical stain for OLIG2 shows diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells while the stain for EMA shows patchy expression. The stain for GFAP shows diffuse expression with some patchy regions of decreased/loss of expression. Additional immunohistochemical stains are performed at Stanford.

A GFAP immunostain highlights accentuation of tumor cell processes extending towards vessels but there are no perivascular pseudorosettes.  An EMA stain shows dot-like perinuclear reactivity in several tumor cells.  An S100 immunostain is strongly positive in the tumor.  An AE1/AE3 immunostain shows modest cross reactivity with perivascular tumor cell processes. CLINICAL HISTORY: Received from Dr. Judy Doyle of California Pacific Medical Center  (San Francisco, CA) are 5 slides (1 H&E, 4 IHC) from patient Joseph Milano (CPP-13-08535; 4/4/2013), a 70 year old male with a large left brain lesion.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE, RESECTION (AC21-001052; 03/07/2021) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE 4, NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED TOLAND/AHMADIAN/COBOS COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this case in consultation. We agree with your diagnostic impression. The histologic features are those of a glioblastoma with a primitive neuronal component. These tumors often show MYC or MYCN amplification in the primitive neuronal component but have not been shown to have significantly different prognostic outcomes compared to other variants. Though an IDH mutation is unlikely in this age group, we recommend immunohistochemical testing in all glioblastomas given the prognostic significance. MGMT promoter methylation testing is also warranted. Dr. Donald Born viewed selected slides and concurs. Angus Toland informed Dr. Braunhut of the diagnosis on 3/24/2021. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show a proliferation of markedly atypical glial cells with irregular nuclear contours, hyperchromatic nuclei, and abundant eosinophilic and fibrillary cytoplasm. Occasional clusters of atypical cells with scant cytoplasm are present with some areas of perivascular pseudorosette formation. Numerous scattered mitotic figures are present as well as occasional foci of necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The provided immunohistochemical stains for GFAP show diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells with decreased expression in the hyperchromatic clusters. The stain for EMA shows weak patchy expression in the neoplastic cells. The stains for NSE and synaptophysin highlight background brain parenchyma and are negative in the neoplastic cells. The stains for CD45 and CK AE1/AE3 are negative in the neoplastic cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  73-year-old woman with a left temporal lobe mass.

A CT scan showed a 2 cm lesion in the left temporal lobe and a 1 cm lesion in the occipital lobe.  The lesion was reportedly rapidly enlarging and clinical concern was for an infectious process although cultures were negative.   We have received 1 H&E slide and 5 immunohistochemical slides (CHS-10-06236 1A; 2/12/2010) from Dr. Stephen Avalos of Community Medical Centers. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of gemistocytic and granular astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei.  Mitotic figures are frequently identified, and there is prominent necrosis.  A GFAP immunostain highlights the neoplastic cells and accentuates the extensive associated vascular proliferation.  Pankeratin and CD68 immunostains demonstrate blush-like cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, most likely artifactual and cross-reactive.  A Ki67 demonstrates a markedly increased proliferation rate. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this interesting case in consultation.  Given the pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei of the astrocytes, this biopsy demonstrates a neoplastic process.  The presence of vascular proliferation and necrosis therefore designates this tumor a glioblastoma.

Dr. Jennifer Ziskin discussed the diagnosis with Dr. Diane Carter by phone on 6/9/2015 at 5:30 PM. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the stereotactic biopsy received from Kaiser demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm. Cytologic anaplasia is mild, however, a single tumor cell mitosis is seen in the single stereotactic tissue core, microvascular proliferation is focally present and there is abundant necrotic tumor. Multifocal intravascular thrombosis is also seen in association with the tumor necrosis and injured axons (axonal spheroids). Immunohistochemical stains of block B1 performed at Kaiser were submitted with the case. Staining for p53 shows mild reactivity in a small fraction of the neoplastic astrocytes. Ki-67 highlights increased proliferation in the neoplastic astrocytes. A GFAP immunostain is increased in the regions of infiltrating tumor but in general highlights delicate astrocytic processes, both neoplastic and reactive. An immunostain for the R132H IDH1 mutation is negative (external positive control appropriate). A PAS stain shows no significant evidence of CADASIL.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:      Received from Washington Hospital Healthcare System, Fremont, California are 5 H&E stained slides (sections and one smear) labelled S98-7277 FS, 2-5, and 1 paraffin block labelled S98-7277 #4, with a copy of the pathology report. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:      The specimen consists of multiple fragments of cortical grey and white matter, and fragments of a markedly cellular glial neoplasm.  The tumor focally infiltrates adjacent recognizable brain tissue.  It has a fibrillar background and shows focal vascular proliferation and necrosis.  The tumor cells are pleomorphic and predominantly spindle shaped with enlarged elongated irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei, granular chromatin, visible nucleoli and scant to moderate amounts of vacuolated to eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are easily identified.  No significant pericellular deposition of reticulin is seen with reticulin stain. Immunoperoxidase stain:  Most of the tumor cells show weak cytoplasmic staining for GFAP. LABORATORY OF NEUROPATHOLOGY No. 10161 ROOM R-241, TELEPHONE (650) 723-6041, FAX (650) 498-5394 COMMENT: We concur with the submitting pathologist that the tumor is a glioblastoma multiforme.  Based on the predominantly spindle cell morphology, we considered the possibility of sarcomatous transformation.  However, lack of a pericellular reticulin staining pattern, and the presence of weak GFAP positive staining in spindle shaped tumor cells does not support this. Case discussed with Drs.

The findings are most consistent with glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. The tumor demonstrates unusual histology including a mucinous background and apparent neuronal differentiation which may suggest components of adenoid glioblastoma and/or glioblastoma with primitive neuronal features. These are histologic findings and have no prognostic significance. Dr. Born has viewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis. Angus Toland informed Dr. Jurka of the diagnosis via secure voice message on 4/14/2021. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show a proliferation of markedly atypical glial cells with irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei and amphiphilic cytoplasm infiltrating brain parenchyma. Some areas demonstrate a mucinous background. Numerous scattered mitotic figures are present as well as foci of microvascular proliferation and necrosis. The provided immunohistochemical stain for GFAP shows diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells. The stains for CD3 and CD20 highlight scattered lymphocytes. The stain for CD45 highlights numerous activated microglial cells as well as macrophages and lymphocytes. The stains for p63, TTF-1, CK5, CK7, and CK20 are negative while the stains for EMA and MCK highlight a subset of neoplastic cells and reactive astrocytes. The stain for synaptophysin shows diffuse expression in the neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemical staining for IDH1 R132H performed at Stanford shows no expression. CLINICAL HISTORY:  58-year-old man with history of HIV presenting with a few weeks of headache. CT demonstrated a cystic mass in the right temporal lobe and MRI showed a 5.9 cm enhancing mass with midline shift.

There was no history of headache, nausea, vomiting or seizures.  A brain CT demonstrated a large left fronto-parietal lesion with circumferential enhancement surrounded by edema.  A second, smaller lesion was also noted in the left frontal zone. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received from The Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel-Hashomer, Israel at the request of Dr. Griffith Harsh are 3 H/E stained glass slides labeled Sheba 2006 2805 1 and 2 and Sheba 2006 2754 2.  Also received is an I/O form, clinical information and a copy of surgical operative note. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Sections of both cases reveal similar histologic features.  They show a hypercellular astrocytic neoplasm composed predominantly of small round to angular hyperchromatic nuclei in a fibrillar background.  Mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, pseudopalisading necrosis and endothelial proliferation are present.  Focally, some of the neoplastic cells have an oligodendroglial-like component, demonstrated by round nuclei surrounded by clear cytoplasm. COMMENT:  The glioblastoma histologically shows small cell morphology and focal oligodendroglial-like features.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for EGFR and 1p and 19q is suggested to evaluate for small cell glioblastoma or an oligodendroglial component, respectively.

While the differential diagnosis includes gliosarcoma, the staining patterns of GFAP and reticulin do not provide definite evidence. The lesion is best characterized as glioblastoma with epithelioid and sarcomatoid components. The preliminary result is discussed with Dr. Pham by Dr. Lin at 11:13AM, on 5/8/2015. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The histologic sections show a malignant neoplasm with frequent mitotic figures, foci of pseudopalisading necrosis and vascular proliferation.  It exhibits a biphasic growth pattern of largely mesenchymal differentiation with focal areas of epithelioid and glial differentiation.  The areas with mesenchymal differentiation show sheets of spindle cells with nuclear pleomorphism.  The provided immunohistochemical stains are reviewed, and the lesional cells are positive for cytokeratin OSCAR (focal), GFAP (patchy), EMA (focal), and negative for S100, Melan-A, TTF-1, CD2, GATA3, PAX8, p63, pan-cytokeratin, and HMB-45. Additional stains, including reticulin, IDH-1 (R132H mutation), ATRX, BRAF (V600E mutation), and p53, are performed at Stanford. The reticulin stain and GFAP stains does not show characteristic biphasic patterns.  The IDH-1 (R132H mutation) and BRAF V600E mutation stains are negative. ATRX expression is retained. The p53 stain is positive. CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 yo female with history of hypertension and COPD presented with left sided weakness for one day. Left facial droop was also noted. Her speech was altered. She also complained of severe dull headache in the frontal region, which increased with coughing. Threre was associated nauea and loss of appetite. She denies fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea. CT scan shows a 3.2cm irregular mass with peripheral enhancement and pronounced surrounding vasogenic edema.

Histologic sections of the current biopsy demonstrate necrotic tissue and brain with increased cellularity including atypical glial nuclei.  No definite neoplasm is identified.  Immunohistochemistry for p53 demonstrates variable expression in the glial nuclei (wildtype) and Ki-67 is positive in rare cells that are not consistently atypical.  We interpret these findings as consistent with treatment effect.  Due to the nature of biopsy as a small sample, we cannot rule out neoplasm in adjacent tissue. CLINICAL HISTORY: 61-year-old male with recurrent GBM right. Extracting from the electronic medical record we find Santiago Aguilar-Rios had glioblastoma resection earlier this year and is s/p radiation, concurrent Temodar, and plerixafor.

We agree with the diagnoses rendered.  By outside report methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed 93 and 81 bp bands supporting the presence of methylation in the promoter region of the MGMT gene.  Also by outside report, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies detected detect a monosomy 10 (commonly seen in glioblastoma) but no EGFR amplification. Solid Tumor Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP) can be performed at Stanford upon the receipt of the paraffin embedded tissue block. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: RWCS18-5313; 5/5/2018 The provided histologic sections of the right frontal tumor demonstrates a highly cellular proliferation of neoplastic cells composed of hyperchromatic cells with angulated, pleomorphic nuclei surrounded by abundant microvascular proliferation and areas of palisading necrosis.  Mitotic figures are readily identified. RWCN18-1151; 10/19/2018 The provided H&E stained cell block slide demonstrates predominantly degenerated blood with no evidence of viable malignant cells.  The provided LBP slide demonstrates a minute fragment of predominantly lymphocytes admixed with debris.  No viable malignant cells are identified.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FSA: Brain, left frontal, biopsy      --   Malignant glioma                (Chisholm/Karamchandani/Vogel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Three specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""left frontal tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple red-tan soft tissue fragments 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm in aggregate.  Representative sections of the specimen are frozen.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is submitted in cassette A1.  The tissue it is not frozen is entirely submitted in cassette A2.

The third specimen is designated ""CUSA aspirate"".  The specimen is received fresh from the operating room by the Stanford Tissue Bank and consists of a 25 cc aggregate of disrupted tan-red tissue fragments.  Approximately 90% of the specimen is taken by the Stanford Tissue Bank.  The remaining tissue is submitted in cassette C1.   Rapuano for Neuropath/sf MICROSCOPIC:  Permanent sections from all three specimens demonstrate similar findings and will be described together.  These sections demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of astrocytes with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei.Â  Mitotic figures are frequently identified.Â  Prominent microvascular proliferation and focal necrosis is present.Â  A significant portion of the tumor demonstrates predominantly round nuclei and perinuclear clearings, suggestive of oligodendroglial differentiation.Â  FISH DESCRIPTION: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was positive for simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns in 22% and 10.5% of analyzed cells, respectively.  These results are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical diagnostic purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and have confirmed the previously rendered intraoperative assessment.  Given the finding of an atypical astrocytic population featuring vascular proliferation and focal necrosis, we think this tumor is best interpreted as a glioblastoma with a significant oligodendroglioma component.  Sections of this tumor were sent for fluorescence in situ hybridization.  There is no evidence of 1p/19q deletion. This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. The amended diagnosis was discussed with Dr. Recht on 8/11/2010.

A postgadolinium MRI performed on 12/29/2009 demonstrated a 3 x 2.7 cm ring-enhancing mass in the posterior right parietal lobe with central lower attenuation suggestive of central necrosis.  A single image showed a possible second lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere adjacent to the petrous pyramid.  The patient is now status post biopsy, the slides of which are submitted by Dr. Levin of Washington Hospital on behalf of Dr. Treynor for our consultative opinion. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections from all five biopsies are similar and will be described together.  They show predominantly fragments of acute inflammation associated with necrotic debris.  However, focal fragments show infiltration by a hypercellular and markedly pleomorphic glial neoplasm associated with increased mitotic activity and focal microvascular proliferation.  The proliferative rate is increased in these areas (30%).  The submitted immunostains (CD15, CD30, CD3, CD20, HSV I/II [high background staining], TOXO, EBER) are non-contributory. COMMENT:  Thank you for consulting us.  We completely agree with your interpretation of glioblastoma.  The presence of exuberant acute inflammation, suggesting superinfection, is unusual and although it raises the possibility of an abscess, in our opinion there is an unequivocal neoplastic population, which precludes a solely reactive phenomenon.

Size of lesion unknown CYTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS: KIDNEY, LEFT, CT-GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION AND CORE BIOPSY --   FAVOR CLEAR CELL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (SEE COMMENT) LAU/KUNDER/OZAWA DIAGNOSTIC COMMENTS:  While scant, in the context of a reported renal mass, the aggregate of findings are favored to represent involvement by clear cell renal cell carcinoma which is a provisional WHO/ISUP grade 2. No sarcomatoid differentiation, rhabdoid differentiation, or necrosis is present in this sample. Correlation with clinical and imaging findings is encouraged. Dr. Christian Kunder (genitourinary pathologist) has also reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The aspirate smears are mildly cellular and show rare clusters of epithelioid cells with round-to-ovoid nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and moderate amounts of finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Bland tubular epithelial cells are present in the background. The cell block shows rare clusters and crushed aggregates of similar appearing epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm and small nucleoli. By immunohistochemistry, these cells show strong circumferential membranous staining for carbonic anhydrase IX.

Additionally, we have reviewed slides of the prior left thalamic biopsy (SHS-09-40610) for lesional comparison.  Histologic sections demonstrate a morphologically similar neoplastic process albeit with a smaller lesional sample within the previous biopsy (SHS-09-40610) and more material to review within the current resection specimen. Histologic sections of the current resection specimen demonstrate a moderately cellular lesion composed of astrocytes with enlarged hyperchromatic angulated nuclei and predominantly indistinct cytoplasm set within a variably myxoid and fibrillar background.  As opposed to the previous biopsy sample (SHS-09-40610) which contained numerous smudged irregular hyperchromatic nuclei which were interpreted as mitoses, the current resection specimen demonstrates better preservation of nuclear detail with no significant mitotic activity identified.  Additionally, as opposed to the previous biopsy sample (SHS-09-40610) which contained focal areas with marked increased cellularity as well as areas in which cells were arranged in thin cords, the current resection specimen demonstrates a more homogenous, moderately cellular, haphazard cellular distribution. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. Immunohistochemical stains are performed to further characterize the neoplastic cell population and a Ki67 stain performed highlights a 1% proliferative index while a subset of neoplastic cells additionally stain strongly for GFAP.  MAP-2 and synaptophysin immunostains further highlight the neoplastic and native cellular composition and architecture. COMMENT:  This is a particularly challenging case which has required extensive review of the previous biopsy material (SHS-09-40610) as well as extensive review of the current resection specimen with ancillary studies performed.  Additionally, the previous left thalamic biopsy (SHS-09-40610) was also reviewed at the monthly Stanford University neuropathology case conference as the morphologic appearance of an abundant myxoid background with smudged cellular cords was very atypical.  We consider the previous left thalamic biopsy (SHS-09-40610) and the current resection specimen to represent the same lesion with an apparent moderately heterogeneous cell composition.  However, we consider these lesions to represent a lower grade glioma and are interpreted as a WHO grade II diffuse astrocytoma.

Thank you for submitting this interesting case in consultation.  The diagnosis of glioblastoma was discussed with Dr. Thorne at 10:00am on 11/29/12 by Dr. Louie. MICROSCOPIC: We agree with your impression of glial hypercellularity.  The biopsies show an astrocytic neoplasm with prominent back-to-back gemistocytes in the frozen section and occasional cells showing marked hyperchromasia and anaplasia. Mitotic figures are most easily discerned on the fragments of neoplasm in the non-frozen tissue in A1.  Brisk microvascular proliferation is seen in the frozen section remnant but necrosis is not definitively seen.  Occasional tumor cells are seen structuring around vessels in the relatively uninvolved fragments of gray matter in A1, however, this involvement is sparse and might be considered to correlate well with the atypical radiologic appearance. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the provided report, this is a 70 year old man who presented episodic slurred speech, facial droop, and expressive dysphasia. Imaging showed a cystic lesion that was thought clinically to represent an infectious process. Straw colored fluid was aspirated from the lesion intraoperatively. Received in consultation are two H&E stained slides labeled ""UVS-12-22181"" courtesy of Dr. Willes Thorne at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo, UT.

A left frontal lobe brain tumor shows ring enhancement and measures 5.4 cm in diameter with a larger area of surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect.  The second lesion is a smaller ring-enhancing 2 cm lesion in the right temporal lobe tip with surrounding vasogenic edema and the third is a focus of faint contrast enhancement with minimal edema present high over the right parietal convexity.  The left frontal lobe tumor was biopsied and the originating pathologist favors a diagnosis of malignant glioma, although there is clinical concern for metastasis. An abdominal CT scan is reportedly negative except for a hypodensity in the pancreatic head. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received in consultation, courtesy of Dr. David E. Levin of Washington Hospital in Fremont, CA are 1 smear prep labeled S10-1874 B and 5 H&E stained slides labeled 10-1874 AFS, BFS, B1, CFS, and C1.  Paraffin block B1 is received as well. MICROSCOPIC:  The smear prep slide shows a proliferation of cells with variably sized nuclei set in a fibrillar background. The frozen sections show a moderately cellular, infiltrative neoplasm composed of astrocytic cells with angular nuclei. Vascular proliferation and focal necrosis are identified.  An additional tumor cell population characterized by cells with perinuclear clearing and rounded nuclei is identified in the permanent sections.  These oligodendroglial-like cells form nodular foci in addition to showing more diffuse infiltration. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this interesting case in consultation.

HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 6/5/2014 5:40 PM **ADDENDUM** ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to report the results of a molecular study to evaluate for MGMT promoter methylation. MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. ADDENDUM DESCRIPTION:  This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

We agree with the prior diagnoses for this patient's resection and post-treatment biopsies. Specifically, we agree with the diagnosis of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV on the initial resection specimen from 9/2/2015 (S15-2656). By report, outside molecular testing at Response Genetics for MGMT promoter methylation testing was negative. The post-treatment biopsy specimen from 4/18/2016 (S16-1393), reportedly targeting a contrast enhancing focus at the margin of the prior resection, is a small biopsy demonstrating gliosarcoma. Gliosarcoma is not observed in the examined representative sections from the prior resection. The subsequent hematoma resection specimen from 4/21/2016 (S16-1453) demonstrates blood clot and fragments of brain with reactive gliosis, necrosis and radiation vasculopathy but no tumor. Clinical and radiologic correlation is necessary. Dr. Donald Born has also reviewed the provided slides and he agrees with the diagnoses. MICROSCOPIC: The provided histologic sections of the initial resection specimen from 9/2/2015 (Slides 1A, 2A and 3B; S15-2656) demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm with cytologic anaplasia, increased mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. The provided histologic sections from 4/18/2016 (Slides 1A and 1B; S16-1393) demonstrate a mitotically active astrocytic neoplasm with spindle cell morphology and fascicular pattern growth, findings diagnostic of gliosarcoma. By report, the tumor was negative for GFAP and focally positive for SMA. There are also treatment related changes in the adjacent brain. The provided histologic sections from 4/21/2016 (Slides A and C; S16-1453) demonstrate hemorrhage and fragments of brain with treatment effects including reactive gliosis, radiation vasculopathy, and necrosis. These sections show no significant neoplastic cellularity and are thus negative for recurrent/residual tumor. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per report, the patient is a 63 year old man with history of left frontotemporal glioblastoma, MGMT negative s/p radiation and 2 cycles of Temodar as well as two surgical resections, most recently on 4/18/16 complicated by large IPH into the resection cavity s/p resection on 4/21/16.

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. All controls show appropriate reactivity. DIAGNOSIS: BRAIN, LEFT TUMOR, EXCISION (CPP-14-02270; 1/27/2014) --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) --   NEGATIVE BY FISH FOR 1p/19q DELETIONS ZISKIN/CHERRY/VOGEL COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation.  The provided histologic sections demonstrate a malignant glial proliferation with sheeting architecture and parenchymal infiltration.  In some areas the neoplastic cells are characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei with variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and other areas show predominance of round nuclei with perinuclear halos, delicate vasculature and a myxoid background.  Increased mitotic activity and small foci of microvascular proliferation are present.  Rare vessels show intravascular thrombosis.  An immunohistochemical stain for the IDH1 R132H mutation is negative and FISH studies show no evidence for 1p/19q deletions (see FISH description below).  While the foci with round nuclei and perinuclear halos raises consideration for oligodendroglial differentiation, the sheet-like growth pattern, areas of predominantly angular hyperchromatic nuclei,  and absence of both IDH1 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion are most compatible with an astrocytic neoplasm.  In our opinion, the findings are those of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. Dr. Born has reviewed the slides and agrees with this diagnosis. FISH DESCRIPTION: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe sets demonstrated 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns in 14.5% and 16% of analyzed cells, respectively.  These results are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

This highly cellular glial neoplasm has some areas that appear oligodendroglial as well numerous mitotic figures, necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The FISH for 1p/19q co-deletion is negative (only 1p deleted, 19q not deleted). These findings warrant classification of this tumor an IDH1 R132 mutated glioblastoma. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the preliminary results to Dr. Bella Goyal on 08/24/2018. MICROSCOPY: The provided H&E sections reveal an infiltrative glial neoplasm with a solid component (specimen B).  The nuclear features are relatively monotonous with some nuclear irregularities.  Mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation and areas of pseudo-palisading necrosis are present.  Infiltrated brain tissues demonstrate prominent perivascular cuffing by neoplastic glia with some areas showing perinuclear halos (specimen A). Provided immunohistochemical stains (IDH1 R132H, p53, GFAP) and stains performed at Stanford (p53 and ATRX) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells express GFAP and IDH1 R132H. ATRX shows diffuse nuclear positivity (non-mutated/wildtype) and p53 is positive in scattered cells (non-mutated/wildtype). FISH DESCRIPTION: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was positive for simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns in 40% and 13% of analyzed cells, respectively.  These results are above the established detection threshold for 1p36 (30%) and below the detection threshold for 19q13 (30%) and are considered positive for 1p36 and negative for 19q13 detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

The mass was resected on 3/26/10 and is being seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Carlley of Eden Medical Center. GROSS DESCRIPTION: Four H&E-stained slides (ES10-542, A1 and A2, B, C) and one paraffin block (ES10-542, C) are received. MICROSCOPIC:  The specimens demonstrate similar features and will be described together.  The submitted histologic sections show a neoplastic glial population characterized by angulated and hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular borders.  The atypical cells diffusely infiltrate the brain parenchyma and are concentrated along vessels and around neurons.  Foci of increased cellularity and mitotic activity are observed, as are vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this case in consultation.  We concur with your previously communicated diagnosis of glioblastoma. While we do note perinuclear clearing in a small subset of tumor cells, we do not favor the presence of a significant oligodendroglial component.

We agree with the originating pathologist's diagnosis of glioblastoma. Per the outside report, the tumor is H3.3 K27M mutant.  MGMT promoter methylation testing can be performed at Stanford upon request. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The submitted histologic sections of the resection specimen demonstrate an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, variably coarse and open chromatin and occasionally prominent nucleoli. Markedly enlarged and bizarre neoplastic cells are readily discerned. Mitotic activity is brisk and notable for multiple frequent atypical forms. The background is variably dense to fibrillar with diffuse microvascular proliferation. Extensive hemorrhage and necrosis are present.  Pertinent submitted immunohistochemistry shows the neoplastic cells are negative for an IDH1 R132H mutation, have preserved nuclear ATRX expression, do not show evidence of a p53 mutation and are variably positive for GFAP. Ki67 is positive in about 10% of nuclei (proliferation index).  CD34 confirms extensive microvascular proliferation. Additionally neoplastic cells are variably positive for oligo-2 and negative for NeuN, neurofilament, SMI-31, synaptophysin, Her2 and BRAF. Rare PD-1 positive cells are seen. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extracting from our electronic medical, the patient is a 27 year-old female with a few month history of night sweats, increased frequency of headaches and transient episodes of left arm and heel numbness, who presented to an outside hospital on 3/15/16 with a severe headache that awoke her from sleep. An MRI scan showed heterogenous, necrotic mass centered in the right corona radiata with surrounding edeama suspicious for a high-grade glial neoplasm.

We have reviewed the frozen section slides and concur with the intraoperative consultation diagnosis. The current biopsies and CUSA specimen (A-C) show fragments of necrosis, brain parenchyma with abundant macrophages, and focal areas suspicious for involvement by infiltrating glioma. The cellularity of regions containing cells suspicious as neoplastic is less than previously. There are no mitotic figures in the suspicious cells. We do not see pseudopalisading necrosis. There are abnormal blood vessels but not typical microvascular proliferation. We gained support for infiltrates that included abnormal glial cells strongly immunoreactive for EGFR (prepared on sections from block C1), as was seen in prior neoplastic cells.  The features are compatible with a component of residual/recurrent infiltrating neoplastic glial cells with extensive treatment effect.  A WHO grade can not be assigned as the paucity of neoplastic cells, lack of mitotic activity and presence of coagulative necrosis do not fit into a WHO grading category.  Further clinical and radiological correlation is indicated. CLINICAL HISTORY: 59-year-old, with a history of a right frontoparietal glioblastoma (MGMT unmethylated and EGFR viii negative), WHO grade 4, and is status post resection of the tumor onÂ October 18, 2013 at Stanford. He has developed worsening of left sided weakness. MRI is concerning for progression of disease, as there is increased enhancement in the area of the resection cavity and extending medially toward the thalamus, into the deep white matter tract.Â  OPERATION: Right parietal craniotomy for tumor resection.

We have reviewed the submitted materials and are entirely in agreement with your diagnosis. The provided histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrating neoplasm composed of enlarged glia with ovoid to angular nuclei, nuclear membrane irregularities, coarse chromatin and scant to moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity, pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are readily identified. MGMT promoter methylation studies were performed (15H-308MP0061) on sections from the provided block. We quote from the results of the molecular report: This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents, as well as for progression free survival, and overall survival. Dr. Donald Born has seen the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. Dr. Peyman Samghabadi communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Stanley Hino on 11/11/15.

We have reviewed the submitted materials (current case and prior case, S15-48851/SK15-8955) and are in agreement with your diagnosis. The histologic features and immunophenotype of this tumor justify the diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH1 R132H-wildtype, WHO Grade IV. The immunohistochemical stain for R132H IDH1 is negative for mutant R132H IDH1 protein, the product of the most common IDH1 variant. The probability of an alternate IDH mutation in a patient of this age is estimated to be 1.14% (1). To exclude less common mutations in the IDH1 or in the IDH2 genes, and at request of the contributing pathologist, IDH mutation analysis can be performed with the Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP). Clinical and radiologic correlation is suggested. Dr. Donald Born has seen the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol left a message to Dr. Stanley Hino on 12/20/2018.

MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic section of the current brain lesion demonstrate a malignant glial proliferation characterized by closely packed cells with irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei with minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background. Microvascular proliferation, occasional mitotic figures, and necrosis are identified. Immunohistochemistry performed at Stanford on the provided block demonstrate that the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1R132H. The provided histologic section of the prior resection shows a similar histology (S15-48851/SK15-8955). CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53 year old female who presented in November 2015 with a front-parietal brain tumor that was diagnosed as a glioblastoma with MGMT promoter methylation. The patient received Temodar, Avastin and radiation therapy. Follow up imaging demonstrated the presence of a frontal nodule growing over time. This nodule was resected in December 2018.

The provided histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background marked by foci of microvascular proliferation.  The provided immunohistochemical stain for GFAP is difficult to interpret due to high background staining. The immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 confirms the histologic impression of a proliferative neoplasm.  The CD68 stain highlights numerous cells, while many of these cells may represent histiocytes some nonspecific staining of the glioma cannot be completely excluded.  The CD20 and CD3 stains show no support for a lymphoid neoplasm and the HSV stain is negative.  In our opinion, the histologic features are those of glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV.  Dr. Born discussed the preliminary interpretation of glioblastoma with Dr. Pham on 10/15/2013 and Dr. Ziskin discussed the final diagnosis of glioblastoma with Dr. Pham on 10/16/2013. CLINICAL HISTORY:  75 year-old male with contrast enhancing mass in the anterior right temporal lobe and multifocal lesion in the subcortical right temporal lobe, inferior right basal ganglia and medial caudothalamic groove.

We agree that the histologic sections demonstrate glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV. MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR at the request of Dr. Arroyo. Promoter methylation in the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, predicts chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. This specimen was NEGATIVE for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Dr. Bayat conveyed our diagnosis of glioblastoma to Dr. Arroyo on 8/26/14 at 9 am. MGMT Promoter Methylation Testing Comment: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling. Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised.  This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

We agree with your diagnosis of glioblastoma for A-B and C-F.  Although there are autolytic artifacts that alter the nuclear features of the glioblastoma resection in C-F and G-J, we do not see evidence of a true oligodendroglioma component in this tumor. MGMT promoter methylation studies are in progress and the results will be reported in an addendum. Dr. Lauren Edelman discussed the diagnosis with Dr. Mamatha Chivukula by phone on April 2, 2013. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections from Part A (consult slides A and B) received from Mills Peninsula Health Services demonstrate an infiltrating astrocytic neoplasm with marked cytologic anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.  Sections from Part B (consult slides C-F) and Part C (consult slides G-J) show morcellated fragments of glioblastoma from presumed cavitronic ultrasonic aspiration. CLINICAL HISTORY: Received from Dr. Mamatha Chivukula of Mills Peninsula Health Services Pathology Departments (Burlingame, CA) are 10 slides (all H&E) with five blocks (A, B, D, E, and H) from patient Jamie Halbert (PS13-3387; 3/27/2013), a 53 year old female with right frontal brain lesion.

MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm of high cellularity is composed of cells with considerable cytologic variation, coarse chromatin, irregularly-shaped nuclear borders, scant cytoplasm and occasional mitotic figures. There is microvascular proliferation and necrosis (specimen B). Immunohistochemistry on sections from block A1 reveals no IDH1 R132H reactivity (not mutated). CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the Tissue Exam Request form:  53-year-old male with brain tumor. Extracting from the electronic medical record we find John Reilly has a history of a seizure disorder well controlled on Keppra with a right temporal lesion, dysplasia or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, who presented October 28, 2016 with receptive and expressive aphasia.  MRI showed a left parietal solid and cystic, hypervascular and enhancing mass abutting or arising from the meningeal surface. Primary differential considerations are extra-axial masses such as aggressive meningioma or hemangiopericytoma and less likely are intra-axial masses such as glioblastoma, lymphoma or metastasis. There is also the stable nonenhancing T2 hyperintense right mesial temporal lobe lesion, possibly DNET/ganglioglioma and favored to be not directly related to the left parietal mass.  CT chest, abdomen and pelvis are negative for any definite malignancy. OPERATION: Awake craniotomy.

The residual frozen tissue is submitted in cassette FSA.  The unfrozen portion is submitted entirely in cassette XA.  Burtelow/mkb MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The intraoperative consultation slide is reviewed.  In consideration of the significantly atypical astrocytes found within some portions of the permanent tissue containing fewer inflammatory cells, we concur with the intraoperative diagnosis. The permanent sections reveal cores of white matter containing a dense, mixed inflammatory infiltrate including primarily lymphocytes as well as numerous plasma cells, occasional eosinophils and foamy macrophages. The lymphocytes are generally small and occasionally cluster around blood vessels. The population of lymphocytes demonstrates immunoreactivity for CD3 and CD20; a significant larger number of CD3 immunopositive lymphocytes are present.  A focus of confluent necrosis with adjacent macrophages is found at the edge of one fragment. Additionally there are also readily identified astrocytes with abundant cytoplasm and large nuclei.  These atypical astrocytes are particularly prominent in one of the cores in which there is a lesser degree of inflammatory infiltrate.  Mitotic figures are identified of some of the atypical glial cells.  No definite p53 immunoreactivity is found in any of the cell populations.  Organisms are not identified in H&E stained section. No organisms are seen in a GMS stained section or an immunoperoxidase stain for toxoplasmosis. COMMENT:  The patient's prior tumor resection (SHS-04-29252) is reviewed.  Some of the atypical astrocytes found in the current specimen bear cytologic similarity to those in the prior resection.

MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the ""anterior enhancing lesion"" (specimen C) demonstrate a cellular glial neoplasm comprised of malignant cells with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic to clear vesicular cytoplasm.  Easily found mitotic figures are noted. The background is fibrillar with areas of prominent vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. Areas with more spindled morphology and bizarre multinucleated cells are suggestive of gliosarcoma, but the overall features are those of glioblastoma.  Rare atypical cells are identified in the CUSA contents specimen (B), suspicious for involvement by glioblastoma. The anterior temporal lobe specimen (A) demonstrates gliotic brain tissue and no obvious neoplasm.  Reactive gliosis may represent a stage of radiation treatment effect; however, no definite radiation necrosis is identified.

Please note that we only have a recut from the aspirated tissue and did not review all the resected tissue. We agree with your diagnostic impression.  The histological, immunohistochemical and molecular features are consistent with a glioblastoma, IDH1 R132H wildtype, WHO grade IV. Areas with an oligodendroglioma appearance are noted. As per the provided report there is no 1p/19q co-deletion detected. Correlation with the UCSF 500 NGS panel is recommended. At the clinicians request MGMT promoter methylation can be initiated. Dr. Donald Born viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPY:  H&E recuts from the provided block show a glial neoplasm with pleomorphic and irregular nuclei, necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Mitotic features are readily detectable. Some areas show monomorphic cells with perinuclear clearing and ovoid nuclei having an oligodendroglioma appearance. As per the provided report immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H, p53, ATRX, CD34 GFAP and Ki67 have been performed. The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H, p53 is expressed in most neoplastic cells (mutated) and the neoplastic cells are GFAP positive. ATRX shows a nuclear expression (retained). Ki67 expression reaches as much as 20% of the neoplastic cells. 1p/19q co-deletion is not detected in the neoplastic cells which demonstrate 19q deletion only, which may be associated with tumors of astrocytic lineage. UCSF 500 NGS panel has been initiated. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old man with a right inferior parietal mass.

BRAIN, ASPIRATE SPECIMEN, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) ZISKIN/BORN COMMENT:  We have reviewed the intraoperative frozen sections and have confirmed the previously rendered diagnosis.  Permanent histologic sections from specimens A, C and D demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation with sheet-like and vaguely nodular architecture.  The neoplastic cells are characterized by somewhat monotonous, mildly pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei that have no identifiable cytoplasmic borders. The nuclei are seen on a somewhat vesicular background. Mitotic figures are easily found.  Prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present.  Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block A2  for the IDH1 R132H mutation is negative.  The morphologic features suggest small cell glioblastoma, therefore in situ hybridization for EGFR amplification has been initiated and the results will be issued in an addendum.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are pending and will be reported in EPIC as the results become available. Specimen B shows mature adipose tissue with a thin layer of peripheral generally lamellar bone and internal spicules of woven and lamellar bone.  There is no mitotic activity.  The findings are most consistent with a lipoma with ossification.  A meningothelial proliferation to suggest meningioma is not identified.  Further clinical correlation is indicated. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extracting from information at intraoperative consultation and from the electronic medical record in Epic we find Juluen Yuan is a 52-year-old female who presented recently with left leg numbness, discoordination and subtle weakness.  She has a remote history of breast cancer. MRI showed a 3.2 x 4.7 cm right parietal enhancing mass. Note is also made of a 1.4 x 1.4 cm enhancing lesion in the posterior frontal lobe at the vertex.  During surgery a meningioma-like tumor was found corresponding the posterior frontal vertex mass.

Histologic sections of the current specimens reveal a proliferation of malignant glia with variably coarse chromatin, nuclear contour irregularities and prominent perinuclear halos in some areas. Increased mitotic activity, pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation are all noted. Immunohistochemical studies reveal neoplastic labeling by ATRX, however IDH1 (R132H) is negative and p53 is predominantly negative. Dr. Donald Born has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis rendered. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was negative for simple or relative clonal 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns. These results are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

We have examined the submitted slides and fully agree with your submitted diagnosis. The tumor as seen on this case has histomorphology compatible with the more recent resection specimen performed at our institution (SHS-16-8123). Per report immunostains were performed at UCSF with results as follows: OLIG2 and GFAP both labeled tumor cells, the latter showing variable positivity. The provided histologic sections reveal multiple fragments of unremarkable choroid plexus. A few fragments of tissue show an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with enlarged and pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, and variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm in a fibrillar background with prominent microvascular proliferation. The provided immunostains are reviewed and negative in neoplastic cells (TTF-1, EMA and Thyroglobulin). Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

COMMENT:  In the context of a diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma with a gliomatosis cerebri growth pattern, the findings are concerning for an IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. Next generation sequencing via the UCSF 500 panel is pending and results will be reported in an amendment. This case was discussed with Drs. Vogel, Born, and Sobel at the Stanford Neuropathology Consensus Conference on 6/7/2021 at 5 pm. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the frozen section slide which shows mildly hypercellular white matter with occasional atypical nuclei. Histologic sections of part A and B show mildly hypercellular white matter with occasional gemistocytic astrocytes and scattered nuclei exhibiting irregular nuclear contours and hyperchromasia. No inflammation is seen. No microglial nodules are present. Blood vessels are unremarkable. No mitoses, foci of microvascular proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunohistochemical staining for OLIG2 highlights the atypical nuclei and background oligodendroglial cells. Staining for GFAP highlights gemistocytic astrocytes as well as occasional cells suspicious for neoplastic astrocytes. Staining for p53 highlights scattered cells in a wild-type pattern. Stains for HSV and IDH1 R132H show no expression. Staining for Ki-67 highlights occasional irregular nuclei. CLINICAL HISTORY:  63-year-old male presenting with altered mental status and multiple right-sided temporal seizures. Brain MRI revealed a nonenhancing hyperperfusing expansile T2/FLAIR signal abnormality involving the right anterior temporal lobe, right insula, right orbitofrontal region, and bilateral paramedian frontal cortices, as well as mildly abnormal signal involving the left hippocampus. Given the distribution of involvement, HSV infection was a differential consideration as well as other viral encephalitides. Given the masslike infiltrative appearance, findings could also represent an infiltrative glioma in a gliomatosis pattern. OPERATION:  Right temporal lobe biopsy. ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block B1, which contains approximately 70% tumor.

Pseudopalisading necrosis is very focally seen.  However, mitotic figures are very rare and microvascular proliferation is not seen. Histologic sections show no evidence of radiation necrosis. Clinical and radiologic correlation is necessary. MICROSCOPIC:  We have reviewed the prior resection specimen from March 4, 2013 (SHS-13-8361) and agree with the previous diagnosis of glioblastoma with an oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV. Histologic sections of Parts A and B in the current resection specimen demonstrate fragments of hypercellular white matter showing infiltrating neoplastic astrocytes.  An oligodendroglial component is not obvious in this recurrent/residual tumor. A few fragments of more normal brain show foci of infiltration by the tumor.  Focal pseudopalisading necrosis is seen.  However, mitotic figures are exceedingly rare and microvascular proliferation is not seen.  There is no evidence of radiation necrosis.

FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was negative for simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns. These results are below the established detection thresholds for 1p36 (30%) and 19q13 (30%) and are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical diagnostic purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A.

We agree with the originating pathologist's diagnosis.  An alternate mutation in IDH1 or an IDH2 mutation may be present but not included in our testing.  If requested, sequencing for these possible mutations can be done as part of the Cancer Somatic Mutation Panel and requires submission of a tissue block.  EGFR amplification and MGMT promoter methylation studies are being performed at UCSF but results are not available at this time.  Clinical correlation is suggested. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: The submitted histologic sections of the resection specimen demonstrate an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, coarse and open chromatin, variably conspicuous nucleoli and variable amounts of cytoplasm. Markedly enlarged and bizarre neoplastic cells are readily discerned. Mitotic activity is brisk and notable for multiple frequent atypical forms. The background is variably dense to fibrillar, with diffuse microvascular proliferation, necrosis, and florid vascular thrombosis. The provided immunohistochemistry shows IDH1 R132H mutation negative in neoplastic cells; ATRX is retained in nuclei, and p53 is positive on a small portion of the neoplastic cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the submitted materials: Glioblastoma, grade 4. Extracting from the electronic medical record, we note that Asuri Raghavan is a 62-year-old male who had a period of personality change and then headache followed by nausea/vomiting for a couple of days.  CT revealed a large right frontal tumor with mass effect and midline shift.  MRI revealed a 6.0 x 5.4 cm enhancing right frontal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and 1.2 cm right-to-left midline shift.  He underwent recent resection and we are asked to review the slides. GROSS DESCRIPTION: At the request of Dr. Reena Thomas, case S15-20908 (11 slides) is received for our review from Dr. Arie Perry of UCSF, Department of Pathology. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. DONALD BORN M.D., Ph.D. Electronically signed 9/22/2015 6:30 PM   ACCESSION NUMBER: SHS-15-40647"

Revisions to the diagnosis and an amendment comment are in italics. DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 (SEE COMMENT) B. BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR #2, RESECTION --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 (SEE COMMENT) AHMADIAN/KURTZ/CAYROL/COBOS AMENDMENT COMMENT:  The molecular profiling results by STAMP demonstrate the presence of TERT promoter mutation in the neoplasm with no IDH mutations. Following the recent cIMPACT 6 guidelines (consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Taxonomy) recommendations (1) these findings warrant the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of a glioblastoma, WHO grade IV which can now be called ""Glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, WHO grade 4"". Recent literature demonstrates that these IDH1/2 wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas with EGFR amplification or TERT promoter have a clinical course similar to that of a grade IV glioblastomas. Clinical correlation is required. REFERENCE 1- cIMPACT-NOW update 6: new entity and diagnostic principle recommendations of the cIMPACT-Utrecht meeting on future CNS tumor classification and grading. Louis DN et al. Brain Pathol. 2020 April 19. Doi: 10.1111/bpa 12832 COMMENT:   Further molecular studies are needed for a definitive diagnosis and grading of this tumor. The Stanford solid tumor actionable mutation panel (STAMP) has been ordered and will be reported in EPIC. These small biopsies show an infiltrating astrocytoma with rare mitotic figures and without necrosis or microvascular proliferation, supporting the histologic diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma WHO grade III. IDH1 R132H is negative by immunohistochemistry. Dr. Donald Born has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the frozen section slides and agree with the diagnosis. The histologic sections of parts A and B show an infiltrating glial neoplasm with astrocytic differentiation, mild to moderate cell density, and mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Many gemistocytes are noted. Rare mitotic figures are present. Microvascular proliferation and necrosis are not identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on block B2 and show the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H (wild-type), p53 highlights scattered atypical cells (wild-type), OLIG2 highlights neoplastic cells, and ATRX nuclear expression is mostly retained. CLINICAL HISTORY: 48-year-old man with headaches and a left temporal frontal mass. He underwent a biopsy at an outside hospital which pathology inconclusive but favoring glioma. Preoperative stereotactic MRI showed extensive edema and signal abnormality involving the left temporal and frontal lobes with increased involvement and expansion of the left temporal lobe and increased prominence of two left temporal enhancing foci. OPERATION: MRI guided stereotactic left temporal craniotomy for biopsy/resection of tumor CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Glioma ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block B2, which contains approximately 30% tumor. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FSA: LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR            -- ONE-THIRD OF THE TISSUE IS FROZEN AND SHOWS GLIOMA WITHOUT HIGH-GRADE FEATURES.

The diagnosis for the prior resection was revised to glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, WHO Grade 4.  The diagnosis for the present resection is amended accordingly.  Changes in the diagnosis are in italics below.  This is the only change in the report. DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR, RESECTION --   RESIDUAL GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 AHMADIAN/CAYROL/BORN COMMENT:  We reviewed the patient prior left temporal tumor biopsy (SHS-20-13125) and agree with the diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma.  The current specimen shows similar histo-morphology. The Solid tumor actionable mutation panel (STAMP) and MGMT promoter methylation testing were ordered on the prior biopsy, and when available, the result will be incorporated into an update to this report. MICROSCOPIC: The histologic sections show fragments of brain parenchyma infiltrated by an astrocytic neoplasm composed of cells with pleomorphic angulated nuclei. Mitotic activity is increased (7 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields). There is no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. Some areas with gemistocytes are noted. In section A2, areas with collections of macrophages are noted in both dura and brain parenchyma next to the area with reactive astrocytes most consistent with a prior biopsy site. Reticulin special stain was performed on block A2 and highlights the leptomeninges involved by neoplasm.  Immunohistochemistry was prepared on sections from block A2 where GFAP highlights reactive astrocytes and is variably positive in the neoplastic cells, OLIG2 is variably positive in the neoplastic cells and CD163 highlights the collections of macrophages. Reticulin special stain was performed on block A2 and highlights the leptomeninges. CLINICAL HISTORY: Brain tumor OPERATION: Craniotomy for tumor removal CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:  Brain tumor ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A2, which contains approximately 30% tumor.

We agree with the rendered diagnoses.  MGMT promoter methylation studies have been ordered on the block provided (S16-04167, 4/13/16), and the results with be made available in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnoses. MICROSCOPIC: (S15-09498, 9/14/15): Sections show infiltrating neoplastic cells with numerous pleomorphic giant cells admixed with smaller spindled cells.  Frequent mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, areas of necrosis and vascular thrombi are noted.  There are multifocal perivascular lymphocytic cuffs.  No eosinophilic granular bodies are seen.  Immunohistochemistry performed at the outside institution shows the neoplastic cells are positive for GFAP and S100 and negative for CD34 and synaptophysin.  P53 is positive for overexpression and proliferation by Ki-67 index is over 40%.  The provided reticulin stain highlights vascular proliferation, the region of the lymphocyte filled perivascular cuffs and just focal immunoreactivity around the neoplastic cells. (S16-04167, 4/13/16): H&E stained sections from the provided block along with the provided GFAP, Ki67, and reticulin from the outside institution) reveal an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with bimorphic features.  The major portion has small, spindle-shape hyperchromatic nuclei with scant cytoplasm that forms a fibrillary syncytium while the minority component had hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, marked nuclear contour irregularities and variable amounts of cytoplasm (similar to the prior resection).  We identify mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis.  In the reticulin stain there is an diffuse peri-cellular staining while the more pleomorphic neoplasm lacks a reticulin network and these areas are positive for GFAP. The proliferation index from Ki-67 is greater than 50%. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Per the Inside/Outside Specimen request: Glioblastoma.  Extracting from the electronic medical record we find Noemi Bocanegra is a 38-year-old female with a right frontal brain mass who had non-diagnostic biopsy 8/24/15, resection 09/14/2015 showing  giant cell glioblastoma and re-resection 04/13/2016 showing gliosarcoma.

MUTATIONAL PROFILING BY STAMP      --   POSITIVE FOR RB1 K860X MUTATION      --   POSITIVE FOR TERT PROMOTER MUTATION      --   POSITIVE FOR EGFR AMPLIFICATION (SEE COMMENT)      --   POSITIVE FOR MDM4 AMPLIFICATION ADDENDUM COMMENT:  A sample from specimen B was sequenced.  All variants considered ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"" are reported here. For additional details on the variants detected as well as the full list of variants (including variants of uncertain significance) and methodologic details, please see the complete report in Epic.      In addition to EGFR amplification, there are reads identified that support the presence of a partial deletion of exon 14 and all of exon 15, which would be predicted to result in exon 14 and 15 skipping - as has been described as the EGFR vII variant in glioblastoma and as activating.  STAMP is not currently validated to detect this kind of variant, if clinically actionable this finding should be confirmed by a validated method.      The mutational analysis includes IDH1 and IDH1.  The lack of detected mutations suggests that IDH1 and IDH2 are wildtype.  There is no change to the diagnosis of the original report.

The biopsy tissue is extremely scant and shows neoplastic cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and atypia in a fibrillar eosinophilic background.  Necrosis and microvascular proliferation are seen.  Mitotic figures, Rosenthal fibers, and eosinophilic granular bodies are not identified.   The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for GFAP and are negative for IDH-1.  Ki-67 highlights 3-5% of the neoplastic cells.  Synaptophysin staining is diffusely positive in the lesional cells, of unknown significance in the absence of a neuronal or primitive neuroectodermal microscopic appearance. COMMENT: The biopsy specimen is small and sampling may not reflect other possible histological appearances within the tumor. Clinical and radiological correlation is recommended. The preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Recht on 10/20/2010 at 11:45 A.M. This specimen will be sent for MGMT promoter methylation studies. DIAGNOSIS: Pineal lesion, biopsy      --   glioblastoma, WHO Grade IV (SEE COMMENT) DIMAIO/VOGEL I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

Specimen #1 is received fresh from the operating room for consultation as ""brain biopsy "" and consists of three fragments of white and tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. A representative section is frozen for FS1 and subsequently processed for permanent sections. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled X1. Specimen #2 is received fresh from the operating room as ""brain tumor"" and consists of two pieces of brain tissue measuring 7.0 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate.  An outer cortical surface is grossly identified and appears to be  infiltrated by an ill-defined tumor mass measuring approximately 2.5 cm in greatest diameter.  The deep margin of the tissue is variegated,  necrotic, and hemorrhagic. Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes labeled A1 and A2.  After overnight fixation in formalin, additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled A3-A6. Specimen #3 is received in a CUSA container as ""CUSA contents"" and consists of multiple tiny fragments of red, tan, and white soft tissue measuring 6.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm in aggregate.  A representative section is submitted in a single cassette labeled B1.  After overnight fixation in formalin, additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled B2-B3. Austin/pal MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent histologic sections of specimen #1 confirm the frozen section diagnosis of extensively necrotic glial neoplasm.  The tissue is largely necrotic, with occasional areas of increased cellularity.  Sections of specimens #2 and #3 reveal a moderately to densely cellular glial cell neoplasm infiltrating neural tissue with extensive areas of necrosis.  Tumor nuclei are aligned around some necrotic areas to form a pattern of pseudopalisading.  Glomeruloid capillaries, endothelial cell mitoses and other evidence of vascular proliferation are readily identified. The tumor cells in many areas are astrocytic in appearance with dense eosinophilic cytoplasm, stubby cell processes, and angulated hyperchromatic nuclei.  There are many typical and typical mitotic figures.  The background is fibrillar.  In some areas the tumor cells are spindle shaped and grow in fascicles with very high numbers of mitotic figures. Occasional areas are identified in which tumor cells have round-to-oval nuclei with open chromatin, sparse cytoplasm, and are within a background that varies from densely fibrillar in some areas to more loose and microcystic with ropey fibers in other areas.

HANNES VOGEL M.D. Electronically signed 09/09/2004 9:28AM *** ADDENDUM *** ADDENDUM CLINICAL HISTORY: This report is issued to describe the results of FISH and immunohistochemical analysis for EGFR amplification.  The above diagnosis remains unchanged FISH DESCRIPTION: Upon pathologist request FISH was performed on a developmental basis without cost to the patient using with the chromosome #7-specific, dual-color D7Z1/EGFR probe set (Vysis) for identification of possible EGFR gene amplification.  Twenty-five nuclei were examined, all of which demonstrated greater than 10 EGFR target signals and 2 to >10 D7Z1 control signals.  The EGFR/D7Z1 signal ratio was 2.19. Note that EGFR signal counts greater than 10 are considered innumerable and scored as 10 for the purposes of ratio calculation. In some cases this may artificially depress the ratio value.  Such ratio depression was observed in this analysis.  These findings meet the criteria of Fuller et al. for EGFR amplification in glial tumors, i.e., an EGFR/D7Z1 ratio greater than 2.0 and the presence of cells with innumerable EGFR signal (J Neuropathol Exp Neurol, 62(11):1118-1128, 2003). Immunohistochemical analysis for EGFR performed on block B3 shows diffuse, strong immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells for EGFR. EGFR amplification is present by FISH and immunohistochemical analysis. MOES/CHERRY/VOGEL I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FS1/TP1: --   GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (CC/JW/RS) GROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen #1 is received fresh from the OR in a single container labeled with the patient's name and hospital number.  It consists of two red and white cylinders of soft tissue, one measuring 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm, the second measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The central third of each soft tissue fragment is submitted for frozen section as FS1.  Following frozen sectioning, the remainder of the frozen and unfrozen tissue is submitted in a separate single cassettes for permanent processing as FS1 and X1, respectively. Specimen #2 is received in a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and designated ""tumor.""  It consists of a single 7.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm.,  roughly spherical red-white and tan portion of brain tissue.  The surface of the specimen is rough, lobulated and demonstrates areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Focally, the cortical surface is recognizable.  The specimen is serially sectioned revealing white-tan and brown tissue, extensive hemorrhagic material, and soft granular tissue.  Representative sections of the specimen including apparently intact brain and granular hemorrhagic tissue are submitted in two cassettes as A1-A5.  Callahan/ph MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  The sections show a markedly cellular glial neoplasm which infiltrates adjacent brain parenchyma and extensively involves the leptomeninges.  Focal necrosis with pseudopalisading of tumor cells and endothelial proliferation are identified.  The tumor cells are moderately to markedly pleomorphic with enlarged oval to elongated, irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei, granular chromatin, and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm. In some areas the tumor cells show gemistocytic features.  In some fragments of tissue less infiltrated by tumor the neoplastic cells have round nuclei, granular chromatin and perinuclear halos, consistent with an oligodendroglial component.  There are numerous mitotic figures.

The first specimen is a tan mass received fresh from the OR, measuring 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. A portion is taken for frozen section and placed in cassette FS1.  The remainder is placed in cassette X1. The second specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, number, and ""tumor.""  It consists of multiple white-tan fragments measuring in aggregate 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.  They are submitted in their entirety in cassettes A1 and A2.  Morgan/ck MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm frozen section diagnosis of oligoastrocytoma.  The tumor demonstrates variable histology. Patches of tumor cells have round monomorphic nuclei and inconspicuous cytoplasm.  Other areas display markedly pleomorphic nuclei. There are also hypercellular islands, ""clonal islands"", teaming with mitoses in section A1.  Section A2 contains areas of tumor cells that retain their round nuclei, but acquire cytoplasmic ""bellies"" reminiscent of minigemistocytes.  Other areas contain cells with irregular, angulated nuclei, prominent cytoplasm and cell processes, where the tumor acquires features of gemistocytic astrocytoma.  A single small focus of palisading necrosis is seen. COMMENT: We reviewed previous sections of this tumor (SHS 97-27474), which was diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma.  The previously resected tumor contained areas of pleomorphic cells like the present tumor, and a repeat MIB-1 confirms low mitotic index (1-3%).  The present tumor is extremely hypercellular, shows abundant mitoses and prominent astrocytic component. The degree of anaplasia and the rare foci of necrosis are bordering on glioblastoma multiforme.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Parietal-occipital lesion. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen designated ""brain tumor"" consists of four fragments of brain involved by tumor, measuring 7.0 x 8.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. The surfaces of the brain appear generally unremarkable; however, tumor appears to abut but not breach the cerebral cortex surface. The tumor has a heterogenous tan-yellow to tan brown appearance with focal areas of necrosis and congestion.  No definitive areas of hemorrhage are seen. The tumor is generally very friable.  Specimen is serially sectioned to reveal brain tissue with focal areas of congestion and homogenous smooth friable tan white tumor surface. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A1-A3. The specimen designated ""CUSA irrigation of brain tumor"" is received in a saline filled container labeled with the patient's name. The solution is filtered multiple fragments of pink-to-tan white soft tissue measuring 7.5 x 7.0 x 1.5 cm.  Representative sections are submitted into cassettes B1-B2. MICROSCOPY: Histologic sections demonstrate a moderately cellular neoplastic proliferation with a strongly fibrillated background containing interspersed capillaries.  The tumor cells display moderate nuclear pleomorphism and have fine punctate chromatin.  Prominent nucleoli and mitoses are infrequent. The nuclei range from oval to elongated in shape and some show irregular nuclear outlines.  There is a vague perivascular rosette formation noted around many blood vessels. In some areas the tumor cells show perinuclear halos reminiscent of oligodendroglioma cells or clear cell ependymoma. Focal tumor cell necrosis is identified in slide A3.  There is a large patch of necrosis associated with a prominent vessel containing a hyalin thrombus.  Many of the macrophages present in this specimen are mitotically active. Immunohistochemistry: A GFAP stain is focally positive while EMA and P53 are negative. MIB1 shows a proliferation rate of up to 7%; however, significant number of the MIB1 positive cells are macrophages. One micron toluidine blue stained, plastic-embedded sections (EM Block #  01-201  A-K ):  show representative cellular areas of the tumor demonstrating a fibrillary background. Ultrastructure (EM Block # 01-201 D & E):  photomicrographs show numerous glial tumor cells with evenly dispersed, finely clumped chromatin. The fibrillary nature of the tumor is well demonstrated. Rare partially degraded structures suggestive of cilia are noted (print #25403); however, presence of cilia, villi basal bodies and ""zipper-shaped' in sufficient number is not present to warrant a diagnosis of ependymoma.

However the findings in the present resection specimen are somewhat suggestive of anaplastic ependymoma, but this could not be confirmed ultrastructurally. Therefore, we decided to classify the present specimen as an anaplastic astrocytoma. I have personally reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

The frozen section is reviewed and the diagnosis rendered intraoperative is confirmed. The findings raise the possibility of a malignant glioma with PNET-like differentiation (see reference), which is of clinical significance as it could imply that the tumor has a greater propensity for craniospinal dissemination. Permanent sections of the current case reveal residual/recurrent neoplasm; however the histomorphology shows some striking departures from what we previously found in the patient's resection materials. The tumor now demonstrates some characteristics of neural differentiation, in the form of frequent nests of malignant cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, primitive chromatin, molding and minimal cytoplasm. Some areas of tumor are more astrocytoid in appearance, and mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis are again present. IDH1 (R132H) immunohistochemistry is negative. Synaptophysin shows patchy labeling of neoplastic cells in the areas with a more neural phenotype. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

Breitweser for Neuropath.. MICROSCOPIC:  Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnoses as above.  Sections from all the specimens demonstrate similar findings and are described together.  They show a highly cellular glial neoplasm characterized by moderately enlarged, angulated, hyperchromatic nucleus.  Some areas show perinuclear clearing and delicate, branching vessels.  Focally, tumor cells aggregate in small clusters with a background of Â¿neuropilÂ¿-like parenchyma (best seen in slide A1).  Entrapped neurons within the advancing edge of the tumor are prominent in specimen B (left frontal medial margin).  Vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are readily identified in all the specimens. Immunohistochemistry:  Immunohistochemistry with synaptophysin is performed to better characterize the nature of the tumor cell clusters in slides A1, with comparison to slide A2.  Stains highlight these tumor cell clusters with synaptophysin reactivity within the tumor cells and the background parenchyma. COMMENT:  The presence of synaptophysin reactivity within a subset of tumor cell clusters is interesting and raises the possibility of some neuronal differentiation; however, the significance of this finding is uncertain.  Overall, the features of the lesion are those of a glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.

A MRI without contrast of the brain revealed a 1.8 cm cystic area in the right posterior temporal lobe with adjacent increased signal of the deep white matter.  Focal enhancement of the lesion was demonstrated. The radiographic differential included an area of old insult versus a low-grade glioma. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received from Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV courtesy of D. James Lawrie, M.D., is a single H&E stained section (SM02-02967, B-1) and the corresponding GFAP immunoperoxidase prepared slide.  Also received is a consult letter, copies of the MRI reports and patient billing information sheet. The corresponding tissue block was requested MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The H&E stained section shows a hypercellular astrocytic neoplasm of moderate to focally marked pleomorphic tumor cells with coarse chromatin and nuclear membrane irregularities.  A few tumor cells show pseudonuclear inclusions.  Eosinophilic granular bodies and rare mitoses are identified.  Necrosis is not present. Subarachnoid spread of the tumor is seen.  A reticulin stain predominantly highlights blood vessels. Review of immunohistochemistry: for GFAP shows immunoreactivity for the neoplastic astrocytes and background neuropil. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for synaptophysin, Mib-1 and alpha-1-antitrypsin.  The neoplasm shows no immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and scattered strong immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antitrypsin.  Overall, the neoplasm demonstrates a Mib-1 labelling index of approximately 1%. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending this case in consultation.  The histomorphology of the neoplasm, evidence of subarachnoid spread and the neuroimaging findings support the diagnosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.  There is no evidence of definitive oligodendroglial differentiation.  Correlation with the clinical and radiographic impressions is recommended.

DIAGNOSIS: A. brain, right temporal TUMOR, resection --   GLIOSARCOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) SCOTT/LUMMUS/BORN COMMENT:  The patient's original resection from 2002 (SHS-02-21483) showing pleomorphic xanthoastroma and the subsequent 2005 and 2009 resections (SHS-05-31566 and SHS-09-03881) showing glioblastoma were reviewed.  The present resection has histologic features not seen previously and the histomophology now supports gliosarcoma.  We also note that there is abundant necrosis that may represent a treatment effect but may be related to the biology of this neoplasm. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Histologic sections stained with H&E demonstrate a cellular lesion composed of two distinct cell populations.  An epithelioid population is present with marked nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, necrosis and stains positively for GFAP and negative for reticulin.  There is a second intimately-associated sarcomatous population of spindled cells that stain positively for reticulin and are negative with GFAP immunohistochemistry.  In both components there is mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year-old female with brain tumor. OPERATION: Craniotomy for tumor removal.

ADDENDUM COMMENT:  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplasm has a BRAF V600E mutation.  Of note, between 50-75% of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are found to have BRAF V600E mutation, a finding that would be expected if this mutation in the present resection was retained from the original pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma resected in 2002.

BRAIN, RIGHT PARIETAL TUMOR, RESECTION --   NECROSIS AND BRAIN TISSUE WITH HYALINIZED VESSELS AND REACTIVE CHANGES (SEE COMMENT) AMES/AHMADIAN/CAYROL/BORN COMMENT:  We reviewed the patient's prior right parietal tumor resection (SHS-19-11424) and agree with the prior diagnosis of glioblastoma.  The dominant findings in the current resection specimen are necrosis, macrophage infiltrates, and vascular changes, as can be seen with surgery and subsequent chemoradiation.  These findings are also associated with pseudo-progression.  There is no evidence of cellular neoplasm to indicate 'active' or true tumor recurrence.  The absence of cellular neoplasm is associated with better long term survival in one study (see reference).  Further clinical correlation is recommended Reference: Woodworth, G.F. et.al. Histopathological correlates with survival in reoperated glioblastomas. J Neurooncol (2013) 113:485-493. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate heterogeneous tissues including brain parenchyma with astroglial and microglial infiltrates, areas of necrosis, and abundant foamy histiocytes where some foci have hemosiderin laden macrophages. Numerous hyalinized vessels are seen. No definite residual malignant population is seen. Immunohistochemistry for CD163 demonstrates numerous macrophages. The Ki-67 proliferation index is low, estimated at1-2% of all cells. CLINICAL HISTORY: 70-year-old female with glioblastoma. Per the medical record; ""She underwent resection of this tumor last year.

Permanent histologic sections of the parietal tumor reveal a markedly hypercellular and densely packed proliferation of oval to angulated malignant glia notable for nuclear pleomorphism, coarse chromatin, and significant nuclear crowding.  The lesional cells demonstrate brisk mitotic activity including bizarre, atypical mitosis, and are seen proliferating in a background of pseudopalisading necrosis, microvascular proliferation, vascular thrombosis and hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical stains reveal strong EGFR staining, likely reflecting EGFR amplification. The overall findings are consistent with a glioblastoma of the small cell histologic subtype. MGMT promotor maturation studies have been initiated, the results of which will be reported in as they become available. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL TISSUE, RESECTION ASPIRATE --   GLIOTIC BRAIN PARENCHYMA AND NECROTIC TISSUE --   RARE FOCI OF ATYPICAL CELLS INDETERMINANT FOR NEOPLASIA BARRY-HOLSON/BORN COMMENT:  We have reviewed the touch preparation and frozen section slide and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis rendered. The prominent feature in all samples (A-D) is necrosis and brain tissue where some areas show exuberant reactive changes.  However, there are foci of atypical cells that may be neoplastic or, in the setting of prior radiation therapy, may be reactive. The most suspicious area for possible neoplasia is in specimen B (slide B1) where these cells are no longer present on the sections for immunohistochemistry such that their nature (neoplastic vs reactive) cannot be established. Due to the nature of aspirated tissue that represents the resection, it is difficult to assess for possible larger areas of possible neoplastic cells. Further clinical correlation is required. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections from all of the specimens (A-D) demonstrate predominantly necrotic tissue and gliotic brain parenchyma including some macrophage rich areas containing some blood vessels with multilayered endothelium. Small areas in all four specimens contain foci that are moderately cellular where a mixture of reactive appearing and atypical cells are seen. An area in specimen B (slide B1) we consider most likely to possibly have neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block B1 for EGFR. The area of interest ( most suspicious for neoplastic cells) seen on slide B1 is no longer present on the immunohistochemistry section. The remaining tissue on slide B1 showed variable positivity in cells a portion of cells and no definite neoplasia.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Hairy cell leukemia. GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen ""left iliac crest bone marrow biopsy"" is received in Bouin's solution and consists of one cylindrical tan-brown fragment of bony material that measures 0.8 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.  The specimen is submitted entirely between sponges in a single cassette following decalcification (MARROW HEME tag).

PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR: Red blood cells demonstrate 1+ macrocytosis.  Platelets are present in normal number with rare large forms.  White blood cells are decreased in number with a decreased absolute number of neutrophils. One half of white blood cells are segmented and band neutrophils with occasional forms demonstrating toxic granulation.  The remainder are predominantly small, mature-appearing lymphocytes.  No obvious hairy cells are seen. BONE MARROW ASPIRATE: The aspirate is clotted, but appears hypocellular.  Megakaryocytes are normal in number and morphology.  Rare erythroid and myeloid precursors are seen.  80-90% of the nucleated population is composed of small to medium sized lymphocytes with dense chromatin and a moderate amount of lightly basophilic cytoplasm.  Occasional lymphocytes demonstrate hairy projections.  Iron stores are present in histiocytes. BONE MARROW BIOPSY: The biopsy consists predominantly of subcortical material with a small amount of hematopoietic marrow.  The biopsy is suboptimal and precludes evaluation of cellularity. Focally the marrow space is infiltrated by a population of epithelioid cells with copious cytoplasm.  A small focus of residual trilineage hematopoiesis is present. ANCILLARY INFORMATION: Flow cytometry studies performed on the marrow (T12676; 02/06/01) demonstrate a monoclonal population of lymphocytes which express CD19, CD20 (strong), FMC7, CD22, CD11C, CD25, CD103, CD10 and lambda light chain.  The findings are consistent with hairy cell leukemia. Rare examples of otherwise typical hairy cell leukemia can express CD10.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL ASPIRATE, RESECTION --   FRAGMENTS OF GLIOTIC BRAIN AND FRAGMENTS OF RESIDUAL/RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV HOFFMANN/BORN COMMENT:  The ""primary tumor"" excision (Specimen A) includes rare fragments of glial neoplasm which are too small for grading.  The posterior brain biopsy and the aspirate show residual/recurrent glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. MICROSCOPIC:  The prior case (SHS-14-468) is reviewed and diagnosis of glioblastoma WHO grade IV confirmed.  Histologic sections of the ""primary tumor"" resection (Specimen A) show necrosis, evolving hemorrhage with macrophages and reactive astrocytes, one area with increased glial cellularity in the white matter where atypical nuclei surround blood vessels and neurons and there is a hypercellular fragment with many atypical nuclei. Histologic sections of the posterior brain biopsy (Specimen B) and cusa aspirate (Specimen C) show similar findings and will be discussed together.  There are highly pleomorphic cellular fragments with rare mitotic figures as well as microvascular proliferation, paucicellular necrotic debris and fragments of gray matter with minor gliosis. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: Per tissue examination request form: Left craniotomy for tumor resection.  From an extraction of the electronic medical record, we find the patient has a history of glioblastoma WHO grade IV, 6 months status post-surgical resection followed by CyberKnife radiosurgery and concurrent Temodar chemotherapy.  Presently on surveillance MR imaging there is increased enhancement and surrounding edema associated with the left temporal resection cavity with increased nodular enhancement at the superior aspect as well as an enhancing lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe; both areas may represent radiation effects although concerning for tumor progression. OPERATION: Left craniotomy GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Three specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The first specimen labeled ""primary brain tumor"" is received in formalin and consists of multiple tan fragments of tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm in aggregate.

Dr. Donald Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show a neoplastic proliferation of monomorphic small, round to slightly elongated, hyperchromatic nuclei with a background of eosinophilic neuropil. Cytologic nuclear atypia is mild with up to 19 mitotic figures in one high-power field. Infiltrative areas show tumor cells with plump eosinophilic cytoplasm and astrocytic morphologies. Pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation is present. Immunohistochemical stains for IDH1 R132H, p53, ATRX, and EGFR are performed. The neoplasm shows strong and diffuse EGFR staining. ATRX shows focal loss of nuclear staining, but is mostly retained (not-mutated). P53 positively stains most of the tumor nuclei (mutated). IDH1 R132H is negative.

Unless otherwise specified, fixation is in 10% neutral buffered formalin, as specified in the 2007 and 2010 ASCO/CAP guidelines (see References below).  All antibodies and probes have been appropriately validated according to the relevant guidelines. FISH DESCRIPTION: Analytic Data: Block A2: (HER2/D17Z1)      Cells Scored:  25      Total HER2 target signals:    57      Total D17Z1 control signals:  45      Ratio HER2/D17Z1:   1.27 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using the dual-color PathVysion(r) Her-2 DNA probe kit containing a HER2 locus-specific probe (LSI HER2) and a control probe specific for the pericentromeric region of chromosome #17 (D17Z1).  A total of 25 interphase nuclei were scored for the number of HER2 and D17Z1 signals.  The observed HER2:D17Z1 signal ratio is reported in the addendum diagnosis section below.  A ratio <1.8 is considered to be negative, between 1.8 and 2.2 ambiguous, and >2.2 positive for HER2 amplification based on FDA-approved criteria.  Cells with innumerable (>10) HER2 signals are scored as having 10 signals. HER2 FISH analysis includes participation by at least three observers.   Results from the PathVysion(r) HER2 DNA probe kit (Vysis) are intended for use as an adjunct to other clinical and pathologic information.  This kit has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: B.

We agree with the originating pathologist's impression of glioblastoma. We also agree that the tumor shows scattered giant cells with pleomorphic features. However, the diagnosis of giant cell glioblastoma is typically made in the setting of a positive p53 mutation. As we do not have such information, this lesion is best characterized as glioblastoma with giant cell features. Correlation with p53 mutation status is recommended for additional prognostic information. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC: Histologic sections of specimens A and B show highly cellular proliferation of neoplastic astrocytes with nucleomegaly, irregular nuclear contours and variable hyperchromasia. Some cells show epithelioid to rhabdoid features with their prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. Scattered, multinucleated giant cells with bizarre, atypical nuclei and nuclear inclusions are seen. There is focal microvascular proliferation. One mitotic figure is identified. CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69 year old man with a right brain lesion. Imaging on 3/21/12 revealed a large right posterior temporal complex solid and cystic mass most likely representing glioblastoma or higher grade astrocytoma. The mass measured 6.5 x 3.5 cm and involved the right posterior temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FS1:  BRAIN, RIGHT PARIETAL MASS, RESECTION --   HIGH GRADE GLIAL NEOPLASM AND NECROSIS (Jorden/Sobel) GROSS DESCRIPTION:   The specimen is received in three parts labeled with the patient's name, ""Duarte,"" and medical record number. Specimen #1 designated ""brain tumor,"" is received fresh in the OR and consists of a single fragment of tan, soft tissue measuring approximately 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  Two portions of the specimen are submitted for frozen section and the remaining frozen tissue is subsequently submitted in cassettes FS1A and FS1B.  The remaining non-frozen tissue is submitted in cassette X1. Specimen #2 is received fresh from the OR designated ""brain tumor additional,"" and consists of multiple hemorrhagic, tan-yellow, soft tissue fragments measuring in aggregate approximately 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A3. Specimen #3 is received in formalin, labeled ""right parietal tumor,"" and consists of a single irregularly shaped, tan-pink soft tissue fragment measuring 3.7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal portions of normal cortical gray and white matter, as well as tan-white areas of necrosis.  Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1-B4 (greater than 80% of the specimen is submitted).  Holsten for Feliz/sat MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  The permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of necrosis and a high-grade glial neoplasm.  The tumor is moderately to markedly hypercellular.  The majority of the tumor is present within the white matter but tumor cells diffusely infiltrate into the overlying cortical ribbon.  Marked cytologic atypia is present: the great majority of the tumor cells have elongated, and hyperchromatic nuclei. There are some foci of tumor cells, which have oval nuclei.  Large areas of pseudo-palisading around necrosis (slide B2), endothelial cell proliferation, atypical mitotic figures and neovascularization, all characteristics of a high-grade astrocytic tumor are present.  Subarachnoid spread of the tumor cells is seen in slide B1. COMMENT:   The presence of nuclear pleomorphism, atypical mitotic figures, endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularization, and pseudo-palisading around necrosis are defining features of glioblastoma multiforme. We do not have prior material on the patient's colon cancer for review but a malignant epithelial component, suggestive of colon carcinoma, is not present in this specimen.

Each of the five fragments measures approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.  One fragment is frozen as FS1.  The remainder of the frozen tissue is thawed and submitted for permanent section in cassette FS1.  The remaining unfrozen tissue is submitted entirely in cassettes X1A, X1B, and X1C. Received is a CUSA specimen containing approximately 500 cc of serosanguinous fluid with multiple fragments of gray-white and brown soft tissue each measuring approximately 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm.  The specimen is submitted entirely in s cassettes A1 and A2. McLucas/zt MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of ""tumor infiltration and necrosis."" They show cortical tissue diffusely infiltrated by atypical glial cells, some with very atypical nuclei. Sections of tumor show prominent astrocytes, pseudopalisading of nuclei around areas of necrosis, scattered mitotic figures, and occasional corpora amylacea.  Hyalinization of blood vessels, consistent with the history of irradiation are seen. Most of the CUSA specimen appears to be diffusely infiltrated by tumor cells. COMMENT: Slides from the patient's prior right parietal brain biopsy (SHS-01-31159) have been reviewed and demonstrate a glioblastoma multiforme.  The present specimen is similar to that seen in the prior and is consistent with a recurrent or residual glioblastoma multiforme with radiation effects.

He also received radiation therapy and, subsequently, CyberKnife treatment.  He now presents with multiple enhancing lesions in the right parietal, frontal and subinsular regions with surrounding edema.  Two of the lesions have increased in size.  One of the lesions was biopsied. GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received courtesy of Dr. Stephen Avalos from Community Medical Centers in Fresno, California are a total of 17 slides.  Two slides are stained with H&E and labeled S06-46416 A-1 and B-1.  Another two slides are stained with H&E and labeled S04-21160 A-1 and B-1.  Another slide is stained with H&E and labeled S04-20198 A-2.  The remaining 12 slides consist of 2 negative control slides and 2 immunohistochemically stains for each of the following: synaptophysin, GFAP, pancytokeratin, NSE and chromogranin.  Additionally, 1 paraffin tissue block labeled S06-46416 A is included. MICROSCOPIC:  The sections show gray and white matter containing an infiltrating neoplasm.  Some areas of the neoplasm are highly cellular while others are much less cellular with a diffusely infiltrating pattern.  The neoplastic cells appear poorly differentiated and have scant cytoplasm with round to slightly irregularly-shaped nuclei, fine chromatin and small nucleoli.  A few scattered large, bizarre-appearing nuclei are also identified. Numerous apoptotic bodies and mitotic figures are seen per high powered field.  Vascular proliferation and large areas of necrosis, including pseudopalisading necrosis, are also present.  An immunohistochemical stain for GFAP shows patchy positivity in the neoplastic cells.  This stain was repeated at our institution and shows similar patchy positivity.  These cells are also positive for synaptophysin.  Immunohistochemical stains for chromogranin, NSE and pancytokeratin are negative in the neoplastic cells. COMMENT:  The current specimen is compared to this patient's prior resection specimens (S04-20198 and S04-21160), and it likely represents progression of the original tumor to a higher grade neoplasm.  Given the apparently multifocal nature of the lesion, this lesion could represent a gliomatosis cerebri pattern of glioblastoma.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Received in consultation, courtesy of Dr. Paula S. Quinn of Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz California, are 6 slides which include 3 H&E stained sections, as well as two immunohistochemically stained sections for GFAP, as well as a negative control (S08 - 3649 1B, 2D, 2E).  Also received are 2 paraffin embedded blocks. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections from all submitted blocks demonstrate similar features and will be discussed together.  The sections demonstrate a proliferation of hyperchromatic, pleomorphic glial cells. Broad areas of the tumor demonstrate a fibrillar background. Scattered mitotic figures are identified. Numerous foci of microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are identified. In some areas, the tumor cells demonstrate predominantly spindled cell morphology.  The outside immunohistochemical stains are reviewed. GFAP stains, performed on block 1B and 2E demonstrate diffuse GFAP positivity among tumor cells, though the GFAP expression is diminished in the areas with spindled cell morphology. Reticulin stains, performed here at Stanford on the same two blocks, demonstrate a nested reticulin pattern in these areas in a pattern consistent with subarachnoid spread.  Pericellular reticulin deposition is not identified in the vast majority of areas where the tumor demonstrates spindled cell morphology. COMMENT: Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation. We agree entirely with your assessment of glioblastoma. We also agree that while large portions of the tumor demonstrate spindled cell morphology, the presence of GFAP positivity in these areas, along with the lack of pericellular reticulin deposition in such areas argues against the diagnosis of gliosarcoma.

Provided immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the neoplasm is positive for GFAP, vimentin, and S100, with many atypical cells staining positive for Ki-67.  The histologic and immunophenotypic features are those of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  An additional study to evaluate for MGMT promoter methylation can be performed upon request.  Dr. Ziskin discussed the case with Dr. Chou on August 1, 2013. CLINICAL HISTORY: 55-year-old female with history of progressive headache, poor sleep and fatigue.  MRI and CT with and without contrast demonstrated a minimally enhancing mass with a central necrotic area.  The patient complained of right eye blurriness no frank visual field cut.  The patient underwent right temporal parietal craniotomy on 7/24/13 and the entire specimen was submitted for histologic evaluation. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above. HANNES VOGEL, M.D. Electronically signed 8/1/2013 12:38 PM   ACCESSION NUMBER: SHS-13-28988"

RIGHT  FRONTAL PARIETAL BRAIN TUMOR CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old female with a heterogeneously enhancing right frontoparietal and temporoparietal lesion with significant midline shift to the left.   It is unclear on radiologic grounds if these represent two distinct lesions, or represent a single, complex lesion. OPERATION:   MRI-guided stereotactic right frontal parietal craniotomy for tumor.

Specimen A is designated as temporal lobe tumor.  Specimen is received fresh for OR consultation and consists of a two irregular firm tan tissue portions measuring 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.  A portion of the specimen (approximately 25%) is submitted for tissue banking.  Additionally portions are submitted for frozen section (FSA), with the frozen section residue is submitted in A1 and the remainder in A2. Specimen B is designated ""right parietal brain tumor"".  The specimen is received fresh for OR consultation and consists of 0.3 cm in aggregate.  A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section (FSB) with the frozen section residue is submitted in B1 and the remainder in B2. Specimen C is designated ""right frontal parietal brain tumor"".  The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm tan-white tissue fragment which is submitted in toto in C1.   Rapuano for Mobley/mkb MICROSCOPIC:  Sections from the tumor samples labeled 'right parietal' demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of atypical glial cells exhibiting moderated-to-marked nuclear pleomorphism, including several multinucleated and giant forms.  Areas of necrosis and prominent vascular proliferation are apparent.  Mitotic activity is moderately increased. Sections from the tumor samples labeled 'right temporal tumor' and 'right frontal temporal' tumor demonstrate a highly cellular proliferation of atypical glial cells exhibiting moderate nuclear enlargement and nuclear hyperchromaticity.  A prominent delicate vascular network is appreciated, with focal areas showing prominence of the endothelial lining.  Frank tumor cell necrosis and increased numbers of mitotic figures are not seen. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the frozen section slides and confirm the diagnoses above.  The diagnostic features of glioblastoma (nuclear pleomorphism, pseudopalisading necrosis, numerous mitotic figures, vascular proliferation) are only present within the tumor sampled labeled 'right parietal tumor'.  The remainder of the tumor samples show features of a WHO grade III astrocytoma, and, in the sections examined, fall short of that seen in glioblastoma.  In the case that all three specimens represent regions of a single, complex mass, the entire lesion is best characterized as a glioblastoma.

The microscopic description is changed to reflect that tumor was only seen in the fifth specimen (E), and no obvious neoplasm was seen in specimens 1-4 (A-D).  The changes are in italics.  The diagnosis remains unchanged. COMMENT:  Thank you for sending us this interesting case in consultation. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of the first four specimens (A. Brain Biopsy, Left Frontal; B. Brain Biopsy, Left Frontal; C. Brain Biopsy, Left Frontal Tumor; D. Brain Biopsy, Left Brain Tumor) show no obvious neoplasm.  Histologic sections of the fifth specimen (E. Brain Biopsy, Left Frontal Tumor) show a cellular neoplasm composed of astrocytes with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei in a fibrillar background.  In addition, the tumor shows a marked vascular proliferation including prominent vascular tufts.  Overall these findings are consistent with glioblastoma (WHO grade IV); however, some areas of the tumor demonstrate a spindled morphology also raising the possibility of a gliosarcoma.  Testing for MGMT promoter methylation can be initiated upon request. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per discussion with Dr. Gajjar: Mrs. Simons is a 50 year old woman who presented with neurologic symptoms x1 week and was found to have what was initially thought to be two discreet enhancing lesions on neural imaging.  She underwent axillary lymph node dissection and breast biopsy under the presumption that the lesions could be metastatic; however, those tests failed to reveal malignancy, and the clinicians now are considering a primary brain lesion.

We entirely agree with the submitting Pathologist's interpretation of a small cell variant of glioblastoma. While a majority of small cell glioblastoma cases harbor EGFR gene amplification, it is reported that up to 30% of small cell variants do not demonstrate EGFR amplification (1). On balance, the morphologic findings most support a small cell variant of glioblastoma. Clinical and radiologic correlation is suggested. REFERENCE: Perry A, Aldape KD, George DH, Burger PC. Small cell astrocytoma: an aggressive variant that is clinicopathologically and genetically distinct from anaplastic oligodendroglioma. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections of the brain lesion demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by closely packed cells with small, mildly hyperchromatic nuclei, nuclear molding, and minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background. Microvascular proliferation, frequent mitotic figures, and necrosis are identified. The provided GFAP and S100 immunohistochemical stains demonstrate strong and diffuse staining within the tumor. Synaptophysin and CAM 5.2 are negative within the lesion. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with the EGFR probe set (Abbott Molecular) which identifies amplification of the EGFR gene on chromosome #7 and includes a chromosome #7 centromeric control probe (D7Z1). Unequivocal amplification is defined as innumerable EGFR signal (?10/cell) and an EGFR:Control ratio greater than 2.0.  Analysis of 100 nuclei was negative for amplification of the EGFR gene.

The diagnosis remains unchanged. ADDENDUM COMMENT: Immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H mutation is negative.  PCR to evaluate for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene is negative. BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL MASS, BIOPSY (EDS-15-00307; 2/19/2015)      --   GLIOBLASTOMA, WHO GRADE IV      --   NEGATIVE METHYLATION-SPECIFIC PCR FOR MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION      --   NEGATIVE FOR IDH1 R132H MUTATION BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY MGMT promoter methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR. This specimen was negative for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene.  Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents. DISCLAIMER: DNA studies do not constitute a definitive test for MGMT promoter methylation in all individuals. It should be realized that there are many possible sources of diagnostic error. Genotyping errors can result from trace contamination of PCR reactions, and from rare genetic variants that interfere with analysis. False negative results may be due to sampling error or errors in sample handling.  Methylation-specific PCR is dependent on tissue quality and quantity. Histology should be assessed by the referring physician. It is important that there is little tissue necrosis since amplification could otherwise be compromised. This test was developed by Stanford Clinical Laboratories. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Revisions to the diagnosis and an amendment comment are in italics. DIAGNOSIS: A. brain, left temporal lesion, biopsy --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE 4 (SEE COMMENT) NIRSCHL/TOLAND/AHMADIAN/COBOS AMENDMENT COMMENT: The molecular profiling results by STAMP demonstrate the presence of a population of neoplastic cells with TERT promoter mutation and no IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Following the recent cIMPACT-NOW 6 (consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Taxonomy) recommendations these findings warrant the diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of a glioblastoma, WHO grade IV which can now be called ""Glioblastoma, IDH wildtype, WHO grade 4"". Clinical correlation is required. Dr. Steinberg was notified of the change in the diagnosis on 10/14/2020. COMMENT:  We note the history of a left frontal-temporal biopsy with a diagnosis favoring demyelinating disease (SHS-20-13118); the prior biopsy was reviewed concurrently and we agree with the diagnosis rendered. Compared to the previous biopsy, the current specimen demonstrates: 1) Nearly complete loss of myelinated axons (LFB highlights myelin debris within macrophages) and more accentuated axonal loss (Neurofilament highlights scant fragmented axons and rare axonal spheroids); 2) Lack of CD20 positive B-cells, which may be secondary to treatment; and 3) Highly cellular areas containing a mixture of astrocytes and activated microglia and macrophages. The lymphocytic population is composed of small, mature CD3 positive T-cells around vessels (predominantly CD4 positive) and within the brain parenchyma (predominantly CD8 positive). An extensive work-up for neoplastic and infectious processes is negative. Overall, the histological and immunophenotypic findings are those of encephalitis and compatible with a demyelinating process. The clinical finding of ITPR-1 autoantibodies raises the possibility of autoimmune mediated encephalitis which has not been reported previously in association with tumefactive demyelinating lesions. To further consider the possibility of an underlying glial neoplasm the Stanford Solid Tumor Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP) has been ordered and the results will be reported in Epic. This case was reviewed in consensus conference on 9/21/2020 with Drs. Hannes Vogel, Donald Born and Raymond Sobel. MICROSCOPIC: We have reviewed the frozen section slide, and we agree with the intraoperative diagnoses rendered. The histologic sections demonstrate relatively hypocellular areas with reactive astrocytes and perivascular small and mature lymphocytes as well as highly cellular areas composed of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia and macrophages. Occasional mitotic figures are present in the hypercellular areas. The inflammatory infiltrate is composed of small perivascular and intraparenchymal lymphocytes and very rare plasma cells. There is no necrosis, increased apoptotic figures or acute inflammation. Blood vessels appear unremarkable with no evidence of vasculitis. Microorganisms and viral inclusions are not recognized. Immunohistochemical stains highlight reactive astrocytes (positive for GFAP and S100 and negative for Olig2 and MAP2), microglia/macrophages (positive for CD68), and T-cells (positive for CD3 and CD4 or CD8, and negative for CD20). LFB and Neurofilament highlight loss of myelinated axons and myelin debris within macrophages along with scant fragmented axons and rare axonal spheroids. Immunostains for IDH1 R132H and BRAF V600E are negative, P53 is weakly positive in occasional cells and ATRX is retained. EBV in situ hybridization is negative. Immunostains for toxoplasmosis, SV40 and HSV are negative. Immunostain for smooth muscle actin demonstrates a vascular pattern. Desmin and CKMIX are negative. Ki-67 proliferation index is estimated at 1% in the less cellular areas and approximately 5% in the relatively hypercellular areas. CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year-old woman with a heterogeneously-enhancing left frontotemporal mass and clinical diagnosis of ITPR-1 antibody-mediated encephalitis treated with ocrelizumab (August 7, 2020) and Solu-Medrol (August 21, 2020). On September 1 she had worsening neurologic functioning and a repeat MRI (9/10/2020) revealed the lesion increased in size compared to a prior 6/2020 MRI. Given the prior biopsy findings and the aggressive appearance of the lesion the differential diagnosis included tumefactive demyelination and other variant demyelinating processes, and necrotizing encephalitis. Glioblastoma, lymphoma, or metastases were not excluded but considered to be less likely. OPERATION: Stereotactic left temporal craniotomy for open biopsy of brain lesion. ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies have been performed on block A2. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: FSA: Brain, left temporal lesion, biopsy      --   Lesional tissue with reactive changes      (NIRSCHL/TOLAND/VOGEL) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""left temporal lesion (per requisition)"" is received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis.  The specimen consists of four pieces of pink-tan soft tissue that measure 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm each.  In aggregate, the pieces measure 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm.  Two representative pieces are sampled for frozen section.  The frozen tissue is not exhausted; the frozen remnant is submitted in cassette A1.  The tissue that was not frozen is submitted in cassettes A2 and A3.

The histologic and immunohistochemical findings favor a demyelinating process. Our Neuroradiology favor a high grade glioma but the radiologic differential includes lymphoma, inflammatory and vasculitic processes.  There is no definitive evidence of a glial neoplasm in the surgical specimen. Our hematopathology colleagues have reviewed the case and saw no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. As per the provided report the flow cytometry analysis did not show aberrant immunophenotypic expression. Clinical and radiographic correlation with postoperative imaging is required to determine if adequate sampling of the lesion was performed. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the case and agrees with the diagnosis. Romain Cayrol left a message with the preliminary diagnosis on Dr. Melanie Fox's voicemail on 5/7/2020. MICROSCOPIC:  Provided H&E stained sections show multiple small fragments of brain parenchyma consisting mostly of white matter. Specimen A reveals a prominent perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with sheets of macrophages, reactive astrocytes, and occasional scattered plasma cells. Specimen B reveals white matter with dense perivascular inflammation and scattered parenchymal inflammatory cells. There is no evidence of vasculitis. No viral inclusions or microorganisms are seen. Immunohistochemistry and special stains performed at Stanford (specimen A: S100, CD68, CD163 and CD138; specimen B: CD3, CD20, CD163, EBV ish, GFAP, Olig2, Neurofilament, SV40 and a luxol fast blue) are reviewed.  Specimen A reveals sheets of CD68 and CD163 positive macrophages with reactive astrocytes highlighted by S100. Scattered plasma cells are also seen. Specimen B demonstrated mixed CD3 and CD20 perivascular inflammation and intraparenchymal CD3 lymphocytes with associated GFAP positive reactive astrocytes. The CD163 highlights numerous macrophages and microglia while Olig2 stains a few glial cells. The neurofilament shows a relative preservation of axons. Loss of myelin within the white matter is confirmed by LFB/PAS. The SV40 immunohistochemistry is negative. The EBV ish is also negative.

Brain, right temporal, resection --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE IV C.  Brain, right temporal, aspirate --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH-WILDTYPE, WHO GRADE IV LUMMUS/VOGEL AMENDMENT COMMENT #1:  The diagnosis has changed from anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III to anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III on the bases of a normal result for 1p and 19q deletion FISH studies.  Further immunohistochemistry for ATRX and p53 were also wildtype for both genes. Thus the preponderance of the molecular results supports the change in diagnosis. Nevertheless, mutation analysis for IDH 1 and 2 remains pending and results will be issued in an addendum. AMENDMENT COMMENT #2:  Based on interinstitutional review, radiographic, and clinical correlation we believe this represents a glioblastoma despite complete representation of the histopathologic features.  Mutation analysis for IDH 1 and 2 gene mutation is negative for mutation.  Methylation-specific PCR followed by agarose gel detection for MGMT promotor methylation was negative.  Dr. Seth Lummus notified Dr. Sherif Makar of the final diagnosis on 12/21/16. COMMENT:  We have reviewed the intraoperative cytologic preparation and agree with the diagnosis.  FISH studies for 1p and 19q deletions are pending, and the results will be reported in an addendum.  IDH 1 and 2 mutation status is pending and the results will be made available in EPIC.  Due to the increased mitotic activity and enhancement by the radiology, we believe this tumor meets criteria for WHO grade III. Dr. Donald Born had reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Sections reveal a moderately cellular infiltrating neoplasm composed of monomorphic round cells with perinuclear halos. Delicate branching capillaries and microcystic changes are present. Focally, mitotic figures are elevated (7 per 10 high power fields). No necrosis or microvascular proliferation is seen. Occasional entrapped neurons are present.  IDH-1 (R132H) immunohistochemistry performed on block B1 reveals no cytoplasmic positivity (wildtype).

Santos (9/22/2016) *** ADDENDUM *** ADDENDUM CLINICAL HISTORY: This report is issued to describe the results of FISH analysis.  The above diagnosis remains unchanged. FISH DESCRIPTION:  Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was negative for clonal simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns. These results are considered negative for detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

ADDENDUM COMMENT: Immunohistological studies for DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 demonstrate intact expression for all four of these enzymes in the neoplastic tissue.  These findings provide no support for loss of mismatch repair protein expression or microsatellite instability. Tumors that show no loss of protein expression for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 are less likely to be related to a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary cancer syndrome. These results should be evaluated within the context of a person's family history. Immunohistological staining for mismatch repair proteins is performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections, using standard protocols, using monoclonal antisera reacting with MLH1 (clone G168-728, BD PharMingen), MSH2 (clone FE11, Oncogene), MSH6 (clone 44, BD Transduction), and PMS2 (clone A16-4, BD Biosciences). Normal expression is defined as nuclear staining within tumor cells, using nuclei of infiltrating lymphocytes, as positive internal control. This immunologic test (IDX#16-11406) was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Immunoperoxidase Laboratory.  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.

Sections show a proliferation of glial cells with prominent nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. Multiple foci of microvascular proliferation and necrosis are identified. Additionally, there are very large neoplastic cells with bizarre nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemical stains show the lesional cells are negative for the IDH1 R132H mutation. A P53 stain shows the tumor overexpresses p53 in a mutant pattern, and supports the diagnosis of giant-cell glioblastoma.

Histologic sections show a proliferation of glial cells with prominent nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. Some regions demonstrate cells with epithelioid to gemistocytic morphology whereas others show focal rhabdoid morphology. Numerous mitotic figures are present throughout along with foci of microvascular proliferation. An immunohistochemical stain for IDH1 R132H is negative (not mutated). P53 is positive in rare cells (not mutated), ATRX is retained (not mutated), and INI1 is retained, thus providing no support for rhabdoid glioblastoma.

We agree with your impression of a malignant neoplasm. The sampled tissue shows areas of primitive-appearing small cells that support the diagnosis above.  These glioblastomas are reported to portend an increased risk of remote subarachnoid spread and CSF seeding.  If requested, MGMT promoter methylation analysis can be initiated.  Clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Berulava on 8/2/2019. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections demonstrate a proliferation of neoplastic small round blue cells with sheets of cells showing marked cytologic atypia, brisk mitotic activity and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, imparting a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) appearance. Other focal areas demonstrate atypical glial cells with angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, microvascular proliferation and areas of necrosis are identified.  Fragments of infiltrated cerebral tissue are also noted.

We agree with your diagnostic impression and note there is a malignant glial neoplasm.  Although the neoplasm shows ependymal differentiation with perivascular pseudorosettes, the infiltration, areas lacking ependymoma features, and diffuse, uniform GFAP immunoreactivity led us to consider this to be a glioblastoma.  Additional testing for MGMT promoter methylation is initiated and will be reported in an addendum. Clinical and radiological correlation is recommended. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Sean Pittman on 2/22/2019. MICROSCOPIC:  Specimens A and B have a similar appearance and are described together. The provided H&E sections reveal two fragments of an extensively infiltrating neoplasm consisting of atypical cells with a glial appearance focally arranged in perivascular pseudorosettes. The cells show angulated, hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei with easily detectable mitoses.  Foci of microvascular proliferation are noted.  Pseudo-palisading necrosis is seen.  Rare neurons are noted to support an infiltrative neoplasm. The provided immunohistochemistry (GFAP, pan keratins, S100, Ki-67, EMA, CK Oscar, synaptophysin and chromogranin) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells show a strong positivity for GFAP with no acellular perivascular zones identified. S100 and pan keratins are also positive in the neoplastic cells. EMA shows focal perinuclear dots. Chromogranin, synaptophysin and CK Oscar are negative. The KI-62 is estimated to be positive in up to 20% of the neoplastic cells.

We agree with your diagnostic impression of glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. Given the patient age and ATRX mutant status by immunohistochemistry, this is suspicious for a secondary glioblastoma. Although the IDH1 R132H mutation that is present in ~90% of secondary glioblastomas was not identified, non-R132H mutations and mutations in IDH2 are identified in a subset of cases. Molecular testing for additional mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes is ordered and results will be conveyed in an amended report. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. The results were conveyed to Dr. Mohan by Dr. Angus Toland at 17:46 on 09/02/2020. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections show an infiltrating hypercellular proliferation of atypical glial cells that in most areas produce dense cellularity.  The cells have relatively small, uniformly hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, and scant amounts of cytoplasm that produce indistinct cytoplasmic borders.  In many areas the infiltrated background is difficult to appreciate.  In addition, the neoplastic cells prominently infiltrate perivascular spaces and extend into the leptomeninges that are extensively invaded.  Atypical mitotic figures are present throughout. Occasional foci of microvascular proliferation are present with some regions of necrosis. Immunohistochemistry prepared at Stanford on sections from a provided block is negative for IDH1 R132H (not mutated, are generally negative for ATRX (mutant pattern), and uniformly positive for p53 (mutant pattern).

MICROSCOPIC:  The recent resection (SU18-12119) and the 2010 resection (SU10-08081) have similar morphology and are described together. The specimens show a solid neoplasm with moderately pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and irregular nuclear membranes within a fibrillary background. There are areas of necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Mitotic activity is readily detected with up to 5 mitotic figures in one high-power field. Provided immunohistochemistry and special stains (GFAP, S100, MelA, EMA, CK20, CK7 and reticulin) as well as studies performed at Stanford on the latest sample (IDH1 R132H, ATRX, p53, PAS, reticulin and BRAFV600E) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells express GFAP, S100, ATRX (conserved) and p53 (weak and patchy, non-mutated). The neoplastic cells do not express IDH1 R132H, CK7, CK20, melanA or BRAFV600E. EMA shows a weak non-specific staining in the tumor cells. Reticulin is only seen around vessels. PAS does not highlight eosinophilic granular bodies.

BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL MASS, BIOPSY --   GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH R132H WILD TYPE, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) MOONEY/LUMMUS/LAVEZO/VOGEL/BORN COMMENT:  Although there are numerous eosinophilic granular bodies, the features overall favor glioblastoma. MGMT promotor methylation testing is pending, and results will be conveyed in the electronic medical record. Dr. Vogel has reviewed the case and concurs. Dr. Li was notified of the diagnosis at approximately 6:15 PM on 4/4/2018. MICROSCOPIC:  The smear preparation was reviewed, and we agree with the intraoperative diagnosis rendered.  H&E stained sections of the paraffin embedded tissue demonstrate a moderately cellular lesion composed of astrocytes with nuclear pleomorphism and variable hyperchromasia. Eosinophilic granular bodies are seen, including eosinophilic globules within tumor cell cytoplasm.   There is microvascular proliferation. Mitoses are present and enumerate up to 2 per high power field. Some areas exhibit more epithelioid morphology. No overt necrosis is seen. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells exhibit patchy p53 staining (wild type), and are negative for IDH R132H (wild type), have retained ATRX staining (wild type). Alpha-1 anti-trypsin highlights eosinophilic granular bodies. BRAF (V600E) is negative, providing no support for epithelioid glioblastoma. A reticulin stain shows no pericellular staining in the tumor, providing no support for pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. CD163 stain is negative in the tumor cells but highlights numerous reactive microglia and macrophages.  CD68 is positive in a small proportion of tumor cells, but most are negative, with most of the CD68 immunoreactivity associated with macrophages, providing no support for granular cell astrocytoma. A CLINICAL HISTORY: Per requisition form, 66-year-old male with brain lesion. As extracted from the medical record, the patient has multifocal heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the superficial aspect of the left temporal lobe with associated surrounding increased T1/FLAIR signal and localized swelling.

We entirely agree with your interpretation of a glioblastoma. The histologic features are consistent with a small cell glioblastoma variant with EGFR gene amplification. MGMT promoter methylation has been initiated and will be reported in an addendum. IDH1 R132H mutation is negative. To exclude less common mutations in the IDH1 or in the IDH2 genes, and at request of the contributing pathologist, IDH mutation analysis can be performed with the Stanford Actionable Mutation Panel (STAMP). Clinical and radiologic correlation is suggested. Dr. Born has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided histologic sections of the brain lesion demonstrate a malignant glial proliferation characterized by closely packed cells with small, mildly hyperchromatic nuclei with some nuclear molding, and minimal cytoplasm in a fibrillar background. Microvascular proliferation, frequent mitotic figures, and necrosis are identified. The immunohistochemical studies performed at Stanford (IDH1R132H, p53, ATRX and EGFR) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells do not express IDH1 R132H while EGFR and p53 (mutated) are positive in the tumor cells. ATRX is conserved (non-mutated) in the atypical glial cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 52 year old male who presents with a right temporal mass with peripheral enhancement. Clinical investigation also demonstrated a lung lesion. His past medical history includes substance abuse.

We agree with your impression of a pleomorphic infiltrating glioma with focal necrosis.  Mitotic activity, focal microvascular proliferation and some pseudopalisading associated with sites of necrosis place this as glioblastoma, WHO grade IV.  In addition, we consider this neoplasm to be a granular cell variant, a recently described and relatively rare entity (see reference).  The diagnosis was reviewed with Dr. Liu by Dr. Born on 6/10/2015. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.

MICROSCOPIC:  Provided histologic sections and our recuts demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant glial proliferation characterized by moderately pleomorphic epithelioid cells, frequently with eccentrically placed round/oval to angulated nuclei, vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm.  A majority of the neoplastic cells have striking eosinophilic granular cytoplasm while others have somewhat vacuolated or fibrillary cytoplasm. Several foci of necrosis are seen, with some showing pseudopalisading necrosis. In one site there is microvascular proliferation and there are some blood vessels containing thrombus. A mitotic count is 3/10 high power fields and there are atypical mitotic figures..  There are foci of calcification.   The cytoplasm of the granular appearing cells is intensely demonstrated by the provided PASd stain. Provided reticulin stain shows no pericellular reticulin (highlights blood vessels).  Provided immunohistochemistry includes Ki-67 positive in 20-30% of the neoplastic nuclei and GFAP uniformly positive in the neoplastic cells (negative staining in focal microvascular proliferation). Additional immunohistochemistry prepared at Stanford on sections from the provided block show the neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H mutation, BRAF V600E mutation and CD34;  ATRX immunoreactivity is preserved in neoplastic nuclei and p53 is equivocal as positive (some but inconsistent increased immunoreactivity),.

The prior diagnosis of ""GIANT CELL GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV)"" is changed to ""GIANT CELL GLIOBLASTOMA, IDH MUTANT, WHO GRADE 4"". Altered text is present in bold and italics. AMENDMENT COMMENT We reviewed the slides from 2009, and they show markedly pleomorphic glial neoplasm with frequent multinucleated giant cells and microvascular proliferation consistent with the diagnosis of giant cell glioblastoma. The next-generation sequencing result shows IDH R132H mutation and two mutations in the TP53 gene. Giant cell glioblastomas are typically IDH wild-type. However, based on the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, 5% of giant cell glioblastomas can show IDH mutation. The presence of TP53 mutation also is more common in giant cell glioblastoma and supports the diagnosis.

We agree with your diagnostic impression. The findings are consistent with a glioblastoma IDH wildtype.  As per the provided report UCSF has performed the MGMT methylation analysis and the final result should be available in a separate UCSF report. Clinical correlation is suggested. MICROSCOPY:  Specimens A, B and C have a similar morphology and are described together.  Provided H&E stained sections show an infiltrating glial neoplasm with pleomorphic and irregular nuclei, pseudopalisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Provided immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H, ATRX, Ki67 and p53 are reviewed. The neoplastic cells are negative for IDH1 R132H, p53 is expressed in rare scattered cells (non-mutated) and ATRX shows a nuclear expression (retained). Ki67 expression is noted in about 10 to 15% of the neoplastic cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58 year old female with a right frontal enhancing tumor suspicious for high grade glioma with a recent increase in size and intratumoral hemorrhage. The tumor was resected in March 2018.

We agree with your diagnostic impression. By immunohistochemistry there is no evidence of H3 K27M or IDH1 R132H mutations.  We note that our H3 K27 methylation immunohistochemistry is negative such that a mutation related to H3 K27M or another H3 site is possible.  If a mutation is found in H3, the diagnosis of diffuse midline glioma, WHO grade IV would be more appropriate. Regarding the IDH status, based on previous studies (see reference) a glioblastoma in a patient this age likely has an IDH mutation. Testing for an H3 gene mutation and/or an alternative IDH1or IDH2 gene mutation should be considered as part of recommended further clinical correlation.  Analysis for IDH1/2 mutation by molecular testing can be performed at Stanford if requested. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Jonathan Lavezo notified Dr. Stephen Avalos of the diagnosis on 1/24/2018. REFERENCE: Horbinski C. What do we know about IDH1/2 mutations so far, and how do we use it? Acta Neuropathol. May 2013;125(5):621-636 MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Provided and recut H&E stained sections show multiple small fragments of a glial proliferation with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical stains performed by the contributing pathologist (GFAP, Pancytokeratin, Ki-67) and at Stanford University (IDH1, P53, ATRX, H3 K27M, H3K27me3) are reviewed. The neoplasm stains positive for GFAP and negative for cytokeratin. The tumor nuclei show strong p53 immunostaining in approximately 75% of cells (mutated) with retained ATRX staining (wild-type).  H3 K27M staining is negative (some aberrant cytoplasmic staining). H3 K27me3 and IDH1 R132H are negative. The Ki-67 proliferation index marker stains approximately 15% of cells. CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36 year-old man with a history of headaches, hallucinations and worsening of vision for 3 weeks. He was found to have a left sided thalamic mass which measured 1.8x 2.2 x 2.9 cm and extended into the midbrain.

Although the specimen shows extensive necrosis, the neoplastic cells and associated features seen in the frozen sections and, to a lesser extent, in the fixed tissue are convincing for glioblastoma.  At the clinicians request MGMT promoter methylation analysis can be performed although due to extensive necrosis the quantity of viable cells may be insufficient to complete the test.  Further clinical correlation is suggested. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Donald Born communicated the diagnosis to Dr. Joseph Chen on 11/09/2018. MICROSCOPIC:  The provided H&E sections reveal fragments of necrotic tissue with rare foci of atypical glial cells.  The nuclei are moderately pleomorphic with nuclear irregularities and hyperchromasia.  The frozen section has more viable tissue where, in addition to atypical glial cells there is a mitotic figure and microvascular proliferation.  The provided immunohistochemistry with GFAP antibody shows a strong positivity is the neoplastic cells and highlights the glial morphology. The immunohistochemical stain performed at Stanford with the IDH1 R132H antibody shows no staining in the neoplastic cells.

The presence of IDH1 and ATRX mutations is associated with secondary glioblastoma and predicts a better prognosis.  MGMT promoter methylation studies are underway and results will be reported in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis.  MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections of specimens A, D and E demonstrate an infiltrative, malignant appearing population of cells characterized by angular, pleomorphic, and hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic activity and globular to fibrillar cytoplasm associated with many of the nuclei.  There are numerous giant, bizarre nuclei and scattered atypical mitotic figures.  Also seen is prominent microvascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis.  Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block A2 reveals the following for the neoplastic cells: IDH-1 R132H mutation is positive; ATRX is absent from nuclei (positive internal control). CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per the Pathology Tissue Examination Request: Meningioma.  Extracting from the electronic medical record and discussion at intraoperative consultation we find Colleen Cody is a 45-year-old female who presented with blurred vision and visual field deficit on the right side, starting approximately 2-3 months ago. Examination revealed a right-sided hemianopsia and right afferent pupillary deficit.

MICROSCOPIC:  The morphologic features of specimens A, B and C are similar and will be described together. Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative proliferation of pleomorphic malignant cells characterized by enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with eosinophilic and occasionally vacuolated cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders.  Mitotic figures are readily identified (enumerated at up to 33 per 10 high-power microscopic fields). The tumor appears viable and does not display evidence of treatment effect. There is evidence of white matter radiation change characterized by loss of oligodendroglia and astrogliosis. Histologic sections of specimen D demonstrate dura with some more cellular areas of loose spindle cells.. CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year-old male with glioblastoma. Per medical record, the patient has a history of a right parietal glioblastoma, IDH1 R132H-wild type, MGMT negative, WHO grade IV who underwent resection in October 2017.

HANNES VOGEL, M.D.   Electronically signed 9/20/2018 1:02 PM ADDENDUM REPORT  ADDENDUM:  At the request of the clinician the case has been submitted for PDL1 testing by immunohistochemistry. ADDENDUM COMMENT: PD-L1 testing by IHC was performed and the tumor proportion score (TPS SCORE) shows 20% positivity and is interpreted as low PD-L1 expression. The PD-L1 antibody, SP263 was used on the Ventana Ultra platform. The antibody was validated against the PharmDx 22C3 PD-L1 assay.   Both positive and negative PD-L1 cases were used in the validation process. The FDA-approved scoring scheme in the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC): 1. HIGH  PD-L1 expression: tumor proportion score  (TPS)  ? 50%; 2. LOW PD-L1 expression: 1-49%; 3. NO PD-L1 expression: <1%. The evaluation of neoplasms other than NSCLC utilizes the same expression scheme although no specific expression cut-offs have been previously established. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Immunoperoxidase Laboratory.  Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.

Blasts do not appear visibly increased on the CD45/SSC plot.  CD34+ progenitors are not significantly increased, accounting for <1% of CD45+ events.  A gate on blasts is set with the aid of CD34 backgating, and contains a mixture of myeloid blasts, normal B precursors (hematogones) and maturing marrow elements. The lymphocyte gate contains a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes, mostly T cells with fewer B- and NK cells.  B cells show polytypic light chain expression and unremarkable B cell antigen expression.  T cells show unremarkable T cell antigen expression.  NK cells show expected reactivity with panel antibodies. Maturing granulocytes show an unremarkable pattern of CD13/CD16 expression. This immunologic test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford University Flow Cytometry Laboratory.

The original diagnosis is unchanged. MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN COMMENT:  Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins demonstrate loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression with intact expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in the tumor cells. These findings provide strong support for microsatellite instability. Tumors that demonstrate loss of the mismatch repair protein MSH6 are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary syndrome that causes increased risk for certain cancers. Due to the finding of MSH2 and MSH6 deficiency in this patient's tumor, genetic counselling is recommended. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of solid tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and select gynecologic oncology patients may benefit from this treatment.

This classification scheme is based on the molecularly defined subgroups identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (PMID: 23636398; 26763250; 25505230; 28061006). The diagnosis remains unchanged. Of note, the p53, ER, PR, and DNA mismatch immunohistochemistry studies were previously reviewed and reported in the prior addendum, but are reported here again in this addendum for completeness. POLE COMMENT:  No POLE hotspot mutations were detected using a SNaPshot assay. Please refer to results in EPIC for additional details. BETA-CATENIN COMMENT:  An immunohistochemical stain for beta-catenin shows membranous staining but also shows focal areas with strong cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells obscuring nuclear localization assessment. This is interpreted as equivocal with respect to mutant type; however, confirmatory molecular testing could be performed if clinically indicated. Dr. Brooke Howitt has reviewed this stain and agrees the beta-catenin stain is equivocal. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A.

The methylation results show a high-confidence match to the WHO CNS 2021 entity ""diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4"" with methylation subclass ""RTK1 type, subclass A"" (see Addendum). This entity is a high-grade glioma seen in children, adolescents, or young adults with histologic features of glioblastoma, wildtype H3 and IDH, and a methylation profile of this class. Under the WHO 2016 classification, this entity would have been classified as ""glioblastoma, IDH-wild-type, WHO grade 4"", consistent with the prior diagnosis. Thus, the amendment reflects the methylation classification match to this new entity as well as the updated WHO CNS 2021 nomenclature. Of note, hypermutated tumors such as those arising in the context of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency or Lynch syndrome may show a favorable response to immunotherapy (see reference).

Sequencing to assess for alternate IDH mutations as well as other mutations with diagnostic and treatment implications (STAMP) is ordered.   Results will be incorporated into a revised diagnosis. Drs. Inma Cobos and Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concur with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  We reviewed the cytologic preparation and frozen section slides and agree with the intraoperative diagnosis. Histologic sections from all parts demonstrate a highly cellular glial proliferation with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. Many giant and multinucleate forms with bizarre morphology are seen. Frequent mitotic figures, prominent microvascular proliferation, and focal necrosis with peripheral pseudopalisading are present. Immunohistochemistry prepared on sections from block A2 is positive for p53 (mutated, highlights the tumor cell nuclei, including some of the giant/multinucleated examples), is negative for IDH-1 R132H (not mutated) and shows retained ATRX (not mutated). CLINICAL HISTORY: 36-year-old female with 5 cm glioma OPERATION: Craniotomy MRI guided ANCILLARY STUDIES: Ancillary studies were performed on block A2, which contains approximately 60% neoplastic cells. INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: TPA/FSA: RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR      --   HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA      (AHMADIAN/BORN) GROSS DESCRIPTION:  Three specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""right temporal tumor"" is received fresh from the operating room and consists of three fragments of brain parenchyma ranging in size from 0.8-1.2 cm. The specimen is partially submitted for touch prep and frozen section diagnosis as TPA/FSA. The frozen remnant is wrapped in biopsy paper and submitted in cassette A1.

Reboja (3/19/2020) ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report an additional immunohistochemistry that was requested by Dr. Chirag Patel. ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC: Immunohistochemistry for the H3 K27M mutation protein was performed on sections from block C1 and shows the neoplastic cells are negative. ADDENDUM COMMENT: There is no change in the diagnosis. AHMADIAN/BORN ADDENDUM: ADDENDUM COMMENT: This addendum is issued to describe the results of immunohistochemical staining to evaluate for microsatellite instability. Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins demonstrate loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression with intact expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in the tumor cells. These findings suggest microsatellite instability in this tumor. Tumors that demonstrate loss of the mismatch repair protein MSH6 are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS)/Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC). LS/HNPCC is a hereditary syndrome that causes increased risk for certain cancers, including glioblastoma. ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: A. BRAIN, RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR, BIOPSY --   LOSS OF MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEINS MSH2 AND MSH6      (SEE MMR COMMENT) TOLAND/VOGEL ADDENDUM: MOLECULAR TESTING: This addendum is issued to describe the results of methylation-based tumor classification performed at the NIH/NCI based on samples from the neoplasm as unstained sections from block A2. Methylation-based profiling is not currently approved for prognostic or diagnostic use and is reported from research findings. ADDENDUM COMMENT: The methylation-based profiling indicates a high confidence match to the ""glioblastoma, pediatric RTK1 type, subclass A"" class, which is also known as ""diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, RTK1 type, subclass A"". Additional evaluation with UMAP dimensionality reduction analysis and NCI-EPIC methylation classifier also provide support for this classification. The previous WHO CNS 2016 terminology for this tumor is ""glioblastoma, IDH wild type, WHO grade 4"", consistent with the original diagnosis. However, the 2021 WHO CNS Classification introduced a novel category of high-grade gliomas that predominantly occur in children, adolescents, or young adults named "" diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4"" and the methylation profile aligns with this new group rather than adult-type diffuse IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.  We note the prior sequencing results showed no molecular features of conventional glioblastoma such as TERT promoter mutation or trisomy 7/monosomy 10.  Diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma and glioblastoma are both high-grade gliomas with microvascular proliferation and necrosis, wildtype for H3 and IDH, and both can show EGFR amplification although no amplification was seen in this tumor.  High-grade glioma arising in the setting of constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome and Lynch syndrome are over-represented in the RTK1 type methylation class of diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, although tumors of this class can also be seen in sporadic cases or in association with cranial irradiation.  To incorporate the methylation classification and the 2021WHO CNS nomenclature, the diagnosis will be revised in an amendment. References: 1.  Capper D, Jones DTW, et. al.

Given the IDH-mutation demonstrated by sequencing (IDH1 R132S) we favor this neoplasm to represent a secondary glioblastoma. Dr. Edward Plowey viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections for part A show abundant necrosis and foreign body giant cell reaction to foreign textile material. There are multiple cyst-like wall areas seen with multinucleated cells with acute and chronic inflammation, granulation tissue, and histiocytes.  Other areas of part A include a gemistocytic proliferation of cells with plump homogeneous eosinophilic cytoplasm as well as packed small cells with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios. Part B shows abundant amounts of these same neoplastic cells with areas of infiltrated brain.  Mitotic figures are up to 5 in 10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemistry is prepared on sections from block B1 for IDH, ATRX, P53. The neoplastic cells show strong and diffuse nuclear staining for P53 (mutated) and loss of ATRX (mutated). IDH1 R132H immunostain is negative (wild type. MOLECULAR STUDIES: Mutation analysis for IDH1/IDH2 genes using SNaPshot methodology confirms an IDH1 codon 132 mutation p.R132S (c.394C>A, p.Arg132Ser). No IDH2 codon deletions were detected. Additional details are available in the full report on the EPIC electronic medical record (18S-033MP0021). CLINICAL HISTORY: Per the tissue requisition: History glioblastoma. Extracting from the electronic medical record, the patient is a 38 year-old male who presented with seizures and CT initially showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

The histologic features and immunophenotype of this tumor justify the diagnosis of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, WHO Grade IV. MGMT promoter methylation testing can be performed at Stanford upon request. Dr. Lawrence left a message to discuss the diagnosis with Dr. Alspach on January 9, 2018 at 6:00 pm. Dr. Hannes Vogel has also reviewed the slides and agrees with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm with brisk mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis with pseudopalisading. The tumor cells demonstrate mild to moderate cytologic anaplasia with round to ovoid, hyperchromatic nuclei and sparse fibrillary processes, consistent with small cell features. Vascular thromboses are identified, suggestive of an IDH-wildtype tumor morphology. An immunohistochemical stain for R132H IDH1 on provided block C1 is negative for mutant R132H IDH1 protein, the product of the most common IDH1 variant. The probability of an alternate IDH mutation in a patient of this age is miniscule. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old man with left leg weakness and drifting to the left side.

MGMT promoter methylation by PCR testing is initiated and results will be reported as an addendum. Dr. Hannes Vogel viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC:  Histologic sections demonstrate small tissue fragments composed of a variably cellular neoplasm where the cells are moderately pleomorphic due to nuclear hyperchromasia, coarse chromatin, and irregular nuclear membranes.  The neoplastic cells are seen to infiltrate within cortical gray matter where there are some examples of satellitosis.  There are prominent areas of necrosis with thrombosed vessels and focally prominent microvascular proliferation.  An IDH immunohistochemistry on sections from block A1 is negative (wildtype). CLINICAL HISTORY: 60-year-old male with brain tumor.  In the electronic medical record, Epic, we find Javier Ayala has two tumors on imaging, one left temporal and one left internal auditory canal (IAC).  The left temporal tumor is a 4.1 x 5 cm infiltrative, heterogeneously enhancing lesion mass with associated adjacent T2 signal abnormality extending into the left parietal lobe and centrum ovale and significant mass effect including extension into the atrium of the left lateral ventricular, where there is possible ependymal spread.  The imaging features favor glioblastoma multiforme.  The second tumor is an 8 x 13 mm enhancing lesion within an expanded left IAC, most consistent with a schwannoma.

This highly cellular glial neoplasm has some areas that appear oligodendroglial as well numerous mitotic figures, necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The FISH for 1p/19q co-deletion is negative (only 1p deleted, 19q not deleted). These findings warrant classification of this tumor an IDH1 R132 mutated glioblastoma. Dr. Hannes Vogel has reviewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. Dr. Romain Cayrol communicated the preliminary results to Dr. Bella Goyal on 08/24/2018. MICROSCOPY: The provided H&E sections reveal an infiltrative glial neoplasm with a solid component (specimen B).  The nuclear features are relatively monotonous with some nuclear irregularities.  Mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation and areas of pseudo-palisading necrosis are present.  Infiltrated brain tissues demonstrate prominent perivascular cuffing by neoplastic glia with some areas showing perinuclear halos (specimen A). Provided immunohistochemical stains (IDH1 R132H, p53, GFAP) and stains performed at Stanford (p53 and ATRX) are reviewed. The neoplastic cells express GFAP and IDH1 R132H. ATRX shows diffuse nuclear positivity (non-mutated/wildtype) and p53 is positive in scattered cells (non-mutated/wildtype). FISH DESCRIPTION: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH*) was performed with two probe sets (LSI 1p36, LSI 19q13, Abbott) for identification of glioma-associated deletions of the chromosome #1 short arm at band 1p36 and the chromosome #19 long arm at band 19q13.  Analysis of 200 nuclei for each probe set was positive for simple or relative 1p36 and 19q13 deletion signal patterns in 40% and 13% of analyzed cells, respectively.  These results are above the established detection threshold for 1p36 (30%) and below the detection threshold for 19q13 (30%) and are considered positive for 1p36 and negative for 19q13 detectable clonal deletion within the analyzed sections. *Note:  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Stanford Hospital and Clinics Cytogenetics Laboratory.

We agree with the originating pathologist's diagnosis of glioblastoma. Per the outside report, the tumor is H3.3 K27M mutant.  MGMT promoter methylation testing can be performed at Stanford upon request. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The submitted histologic sections of the resection specimen demonstrate an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, nuclear contour irregularities, variably coarse and open chromatin and occasionally prominent nucleoli. Markedly enlarged and bizarre neoplastic cells are readily discerned. Mitotic activity is brisk and notable for multiple frequent atypical forms. The background is variably dense to fibrillar with diffuse microvascular proliferation. Extensive hemorrhage and necrosis are present.  Pertinent submitted immunohistochemistry shows the neoplastic cells are negative for an IDH1 R132H mutation, have preserved nuclear ATRX expression, do not show evidence of a p53 mutation and are variably positive for GFAP. Ki67 is positive in about 10% of nuclei (proliferation index).  CD34 confirms extensive microvascular proliferation. Additionally neoplastic cells are variably positive for oligo-2 and negative for NeuN, neurofilament, SMI-31, synaptophysin, Her2 and BRAF. Rare PD-1 positive cells are seen. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extracting from our electronic medical, the patient is a 27 year-old female with a few month history of night sweats, increased frequency of headaches and transient episodes of left arm and heel numbness, who presented to an outside hospital on 3/15/16 with a severe headache that awoke her from sleep.

We have reviewed the submitted materials and are entirely in agreement with your diagnosis. The provided histologic sections demonstrate an infiltrating neoplasm composed of enlarged glia with ovoid to angular nuclei, nuclear membrane irregularities, coarse chromatin and scant to moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm.

MGMT promoter methylation studies were performed (15H-308MP0061) on sections from the provided block. We quote from the results of the molecular report: This specimen was positive for promoter methylation of the MGMT gene. Presence of promoter methylation, which causes epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene, a DNA repair gene on chromosome 10q26, is a positive predictive factor for chemotherapeutic response to alkylating agents, as well as for progression free survival, and overall survival.

We agree with the rendered diagnoses.  MGMT promoter methylation studies have been ordered on the block provided (S16-04167, 4/13/16), and the results with be made available in EPIC. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnoses. MICROSCOPIC: (S15-09498, 9/14/15): Sections show infiltrating neoplastic cells with numerous pleomorphic giant cells admixed with smaller spindled cells.  Frequent mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, areas of necrosis and vascular thrombi are noted.  There are multifocal perivascular lymphocytic cuffs.  No eosinophilic granular bodies are seen.  Immunohistochemistry performed at the outside institution shows the neoplastic cells are positive for GFAP and S100 and negative for CD34 and synaptophysin.  P53 is positive for overexpression and proliferation by Ki-67 index is over 40%.  The provided reticulin stain highlights vascular proliferation, the region of the lymphocyte filled perivascular cuffs and just focal immunoreactivity around the neoplastic cells. (S16-04167, 4/13/16): H&E stained sections from the provided block along with the provided GFAP, Ki67, and reticulin from the outside institution) reveal an infiltrating neoplasm composed of malignant glia with bimorphic features.  The major portion has small, spindle-shape hyperchromatic nuclei with scant cytoplasm that forms a fibrillary syncytium while the minority component had hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, marked nuclear contour irregularities and variable amounts of cytoplasm (similar to the prior resection).  We identify mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis.  In the reticulin stain there is an diffuse peri-cellular staining while the more pleomorphic neoplasm lacks a reticulin network and these areas are positive for GFAP. The proliferation index from Ki-67 is greater than 50%. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Per the Inside/Outside Specimen request: Glioblastoma.  Extracting from the electronic medical record we find Noemi Bocanegra is a 38-year-old female with a right frontal brain mass who had non-diagnostic biopsy 8/24/15, resection 09/14/2015 showing  giant cell glioblastoma and re-resection 04/13/2016 showing gliosarcoma.

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. All controls show appropriate reactivity. DIAGNOSIS: A. brain, right temporal TUMOR, resection --   GLIOSARCOMA, WHO GRADE IV (SEE COMMENT) SCOTT/LUMMUS/BORN COMMENT:  The patient's original resection from 2002 (SHS-02-21483) showing pleomorphic xanthoastroma and the subsequent 2005 and 2009 resections (SHS-05-31566 and SHS-09-03881) showing glioblastoma were reviewed.  The present resection has histologic features not seen previously and the histomophology now supports gliosarcoma.  We also note that there is abundant necrosis that may represent a treatment effect but may be related to the biology of this neoplasm. Dr. Hannes Vogel has viewed the slides and concurs with the diagnosis. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  Histologic sections stained with H&E demonstrate a cellular lesion composed of two distinct cell populations.  An epithelioid population is present with marked nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, necrosis and stains positively for GFAP and negative for reticulin.  There is a second intimately-associated sarcomatous population of spindled cells that stain positively for reticulin and are negative with GFAP immunohistochemistry.  In both components there is mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis. CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year-old female with brain tumor. OPERATION: Craniotomy for tumor removal. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Right temporal GBM GROSS DESCRIPTION:  One specimen is received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. The specimen labeled ""right temporal GBO"" is received in formalin and consists of a 10.0 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm aggregate of hemorrhagic, soft, pink-white to pink-tan tissue.

ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC:  Additional immunohistochemistry is prepared on sections from block A6 with the finding that the neoplastic cells are positive for BRAF V600E. ADDENDUM COMMENT:  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplasm has a BRAF V600E mutation.  Of note, between 50-75% of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas are found to have BRAF V600E mutation, a finding that would be expected if this mutation in the present resection was retained from the original pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma resected in 2002.
