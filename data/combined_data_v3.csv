Pt presented A&Ox1.5 (pt was able to state name, that he was in a hospital but could not say which hospital, the month or year we are in, or do simple math). This SW and ED SW tried to explore pt's daily activity and what he is needing help with regarding his health and well-being. Pt was not able to answer what he needs help with, except that he needs a ride back to Home Depot. Pt also was not able to explain what his daily activities were either. When SWs expressed concerns for his health and well-being, pt did not react nor respond. Pt had poor eye contact and at times would either not answer or finish his sentence/thought.     SWs brought up his family in Mexico and explored any possible interest of him going back. Pt was very adamant about not wanting to go back to Mexico. He stated that he has not been back in about 30 years and cannot go back because there is no work for him there. Pt was asked about the type of work he does now, to which he was not able to answer. He would continuously state that he works, but was not able to answer what he does for work. SWs asked about his family and if he was able to identify any of them. Pt was able to identify one brother, but believes that his brother lives locally and is a cop, which is not true. Pt was then asked about how he obtains food, to which he stated he will go to the store where people will give him some or he will steal. When asked about his medication, pt reported that it was in his jacket pocket, that he takes it in the morning. Pt was able to answer when the last time he took his seizure medication or any of his medication.    Pt has very little to none insight regarding his living situation, health and well-being.

He reports this shelter serves 3 meals per day, but reports he only eats 1 meal per day since his bariatric surgery in 2016. He reports the food available to him is donated and does not always appeal to him; or is not always something he is able to tolerate (ie. cannot tolerate spicy foods such as curry). He also states that since his bariatric surgery in 2016, he cannot tolerate acidic foods or room temperature/lukewarm liquids without vomiting. This has been difficult to manage because he is not allowed to keep a fridge or cooler in the housing shelter where he stays and does not often have access to cold liquids, so he typically does not drink much fluid. He reports he could likely tolerate hot liquids such as coffee or tea,  but does not frequently drink these beverages. He states that although he has EBT he cannot use it much because he cannot cook or store perishable foods at Life Moves.

Stanford Hospital and Clinics  Discharge Summary    Attending Physician: Kumar, Andre Devendra, MD  Additional discharging providers (NP, PA, intern, resident, fellow): Resident Sri Palanisamy, Intern Lauren Lo  Discharging service: Medicine 1B  Admission Date: 12/11/2021  Discharge Date: 1/14/2021    Principle Diagnosis at Discharge: BLE edema  Secondary Diagnoses: RLE cellulitis    Reason for Hospitalization:    Joseph A Chapman is a 54 Y year old male PMH polysubstance abuse (EtOH, methamphetamine, and cannabis), anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, DM2, HTN, HLD, GERD, and recurrent SSTI who was admitted for acute on chronic BLE edema c/b RLE cellulitis.     Brief History of present illness:  Volume optimization in setting of chronic venous stasis. Patient is diuresing well on lasix 120 IV TID and will be discharged on bumex 3mg PO TID. Patient developed worsening erythema and pain of RLE on 1/10 with symptom improvement after initiation of keflex. Patient has been adequately medically optimized for discharge. Ongoing discussion with patient about adherence to medications, low sodium, carb controlled diet, and fluid restriction (evidence of PO intake surpassing dietary restrictions during this admission). Recommend continued wound care of BLE, adherence to treatment, exercise, and close follow up with PCP.    Patient has a long history of malingering during hospitalizations and was noted on this admission to be remarkably uncooperative with care plan, notably taking his neighbors meals and consuming them himself while on salt restricted diet. Patient also was not compliant with case management and SNF placement process, resulting in a protracted hospitalization and the majority of which he had no inpatient needs. Upon repeat presentation, we would advise that patient not be hospitalized for concerns regarding his lower extremities unless they include: concern for DVT that  cannot be managed with DOAC, cellulitis unresponsive to PO antibiotics, volume overload with pulmonary compromise, or active DVT/PE that cannot be managed with DOAC.     Hospital Course/Significant Findings by Problem:  # RLE cellulitis 1/10  # Stasis Dermatitis, Bilateral lower legs  # Elephantiasis Nostra Verrucosa, Bilateral lower leg  # Possible cellulitis vs furunculosis L anterior knee  Patient admitted multiple times over last 2 months for BLE wounds. Treated with 5-day course of Keflex in 10/2021 for 'mild celluitis.' Continued to follow in wound care clinic through 11/3 and was noted with improvement in bilateral lower extremity edema. Admitted again 11/8-11/9 due to concern for cellulitis and treated briefly with IV CTX before he left AMA, but had neither frank evidence of cellulitis nor evidence of systemic infection. On this admission, patient does not have clear signs of SSTI and swelling appears to be due to edema in the setting of venous stasis. Trigger could have been medication noncompliance due to not receiving lasix at SNF. S/p bumetanide 3mg TID (1/2/2022- 1/5/2022)- s/p IV furosemide 80 mg TID 12/11/2021-1/1/2022. S/P doxy and keflex for MRSA + GAS coverage (12/16 - 12/22). Developed worsening RLE erythema, edema, and TTP, received 1 dose vanc, clinda, mero on 1/10 evening, 1/11 deescalated to keflex. Per PT note 12/13/21 """" Tolerated gait x 70ft using FWW"""" and has been seen by hospital staff walking around unit unassisted without walker and with steady gait. 1/11/22 CT RLE showed no subQ emphysema, fluid collection, or evidence of osteomyelitis.   - Didaksol soaks daily to bilateral lower legs and feet, Mupirocin 2% cream for CoNS coverage, Leg elevation and compression   - bumex 3mg TID  [ ] PCP to follow up BMP in 1 week  - Keflex 500mg q6h 1/11-1/15  - Referrals placed to dermatology and bariatric surgery  - pain: duloxetine 90 mg daily, buprenorphine 2 mg SL tab BID, will d/c patient with  short course of oxy 5mg for pain    - A 5 day supply of Keflex was also send to CVS near the shelter that patient secured placement: Maple Street Shelter. Patient was instructed that he could pick these up at the first sign of worsening leg pain or redness.     # Tinea Pedis  - after daily didaksol soaks (see above details) and econazole cream twice daily to bottom of feet and between toes     # Intertrigo, bilateral inframammary folds  - econazole cream and hydrocortisone 2.5% cream twice daily to involved skin     # Prurigo Nodularis, bilateral upper extremities  - start clobetasol 0.05% ointment applied to affected areas 2 times a day, occluded with a Band-Aid. Please ONLY apply clobetasol 0.05% ointment to lesions that are intact and do not have an overlying hemorrhagic or honey yellow crust.  - for crusted nodules please apply mupirocin 2% ointment twice daily to central crust and clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily to surrounding erythema     #Alcohol use disorder  Patient with questionable alcohol use disorder, but appears to have been using clonazepam regularly until recently. Per DC summary 10/15, he was mostly focused on obtaining Clonazepam as his SNF physician had discontinued it. There was initial concerns for withdrawal, so CIWA protocol was started but stopped soon thereafter because of high scores for anxiety and use of Ativan for anxiety, without other signs of withdrawal.   - Continue MVI and folic acid      #HFpEF  Had TTE 8/9/2021 showing LVEF of 50% with global hypokinesis.

Visit http://prism.stanfordmedicine.org for more details and to apply for a user account.    Discharge Teaching Physician Attestation   The patient is a 54 year old male with a history of active substance abuse (seen by addiction medicine) and venous stasis dermatitis who was admitted from his old SNF because he did not like the care he was receiving there. A medical workup has revealed he has chronic, severe venous stasis dermatitis with no evidence of cellulitis.      In this patient's month long admission, we  have attempted placement elsewhere. He has been denied by a wide search of SNFs within the Bay Area. He refuses to have the search expanded in Southern California (although we have tried anyway and there were no acceptances). He does not qualify for board and care. We have provided the patient with ample opportunity over this month to find alternative housing, which he cannot. We have provided him with a list of shelters, and he agrees to go to Maple St. Shelter.      The patient is able to officially ambulate at least 60 feet with a walker, and has been observed to walk longer in multiple laps around our nursing unit.      During this hospital stay, the patient was attempted to be diuresed to improve his weights and venous stasis dermatitis. Despite being a charted cumulative net negative of -132,850 mL (the equivalent of 292 pounds), he has gained weight in this admission. He has admitted to stealing food from his neighbors, which means his intake and output are not accurate. Furthermore, his total urine output over the last 30 days is -183,605 mL, which is unlikely (even with diuresis) given his normal creatinine and sodium despite >6000 mL daily urine output (on average). There is concern he is adding liquid to his urinals for falsely elevated numbers. The patient has refused a condom catheter for a 24 hour trial of accurate I&Os, further raising our suspicion of inaccurate measurements. In sum, Mr. Chapman has sabotaged our efforts to effectively treat his stasis dermatitis.      Unfortunately, Stanford has no other resources to offer Mr. Chapman, and he has undergone an extensive medical workup of his leg swelling (multiple images for DVT/deeper infection, echo, cirrhosis evaluation, treatment of infection, attempts at diuresis), but he has not complied with our attempts to treat or place him. I informed the patient that we are planning to discharge him to a shelter with 1) medications in hand, 2) an """"on-call  rx"""" of antibiotics in case he develops future cellulitis, 3) a wheelchair (even though he has demonstrated he can walk more than 60 feet with a walker), and 4) a referal to primary care. OT has signed off on the patient, and PT has limited his treatment to 1x per week because he doesn't have substantial needs.      Thus, ongoing admission or future admissions at Stanford without a clear, justifiable reason (e.g. severe sepsis/septic shock for cellulitis) are not in the patient's interest. He responds well to keflex if there is a concern for cellulitis, although we believe his leg swelling and erythema is more consistent with venous stasis dermatitis. We would not give antibiotics unless there is clear evidence of sepsis. More importantly, we have no method to place this patient should he represent for placement, and our resources for helping him in the inpatient setting have been thoroughly explored and exhausted.     Addendum: following discharge, the patient declined to bring his wheelchair with him in a taxi. He has a walker that he can use.

Services provided: final examination, discussion of hospital stay, instruction for continuing care and preparation of discharge records, prescriptions or referrals. I saw and examined the patient and discussed management with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with the documented findings and plan of care, with the addition and/or exception of the items documented above. The patient was seen and examined by me on the day of discharge unless noted above.      Time in Counseling and Coordination   The following is only applicable if counseling or coordination time with patient and/or family (C) is >50% of total attending floor/unit time including face to face  time with patient and/or family (V). (V) Total attending floor/unit time: 35 minutes. (C) Total attending Counseling/Coordination time: 20 minutes. Attending time included reviewing the EMR, examining the patient, and discussion/coordination of care with the patient, family, ancillary staff, resident and/or consultants. Additional counseling provided at discharge for patient for plan of care outlined above.     The patient and/or family were informed of the plan of discharge above and are in agreement with this plan unless noted above.     The primary care physician for the patient will assume responsibility of the patient care after discharge."

I conducted the visit in conjunction with the spectacular nursing, social work, and nutrition staff at WellBound San Mateo. Thank you for asking that I see Mr. Barrientos Garcia in ongoing consultation for end-stage kidney disease associated with  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with multiple complications including disseminated mycobacterium tuberculosis; refractory hypothyroidism, finally improved; a recent hospitalization with substernal and epigastric pain and complicated by incidentally discovered COVID-19; history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease; hypertension, now absent; hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia, now both improved; hyperphosphatemia; and secondary hyperparathyroidism. He was unaccompanied.    Mr. Barrientos Garcia has had several hospitalizations including a 15-day hospitalization at Stanford in mid January 2022, which followed on the heels of a hospitalization at San Mateo County Medical Center with peritonitis approximately one week earlier.     At today's visit, Mr. Barrientos Garcia was complaining of bright-red blood per rectum. He also had complaints of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. He denies fever, chills or other constitutional symptoms. He has been undergoing directly observed therapy for disseminated mycobacterium tuberculosis. He has been very carefully followed by Drs. Contag and Nelson along with staff from the Department of Public Health in San Mateo County. Mr. Barrientos Garcia has been performing his peritoneal dialysis therapy on a regular basis without complication. His peritoneal dialysate has been crystal clear since completing a course of vancomycin for presumed gram-positive peritonitis. I was unable to access records from San Mateo County Medical Center, though I did receive a verbal report that peritoneal dialysate cultures showed no growth.     On physical examination, the blood pressure was elevated, in contrast to reports of much lower blood pressures during Mr. Barrientos Garcia's recent hospitalization and other recent medical records. The body weight was 63.7 kg (subtracting the 2 L of icodextrin solution within the peritoneal cavity). The blood pressure while sitting was 164/78 and while standing  145/85 mmHg. Corresponding pulse rates were 67 and 70 beats per minute respectively. The oral temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The head and neck were normal. The eyes, ears, nose and throat were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower extremities were of normal muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.     The peritoneal dialysis prescription consists of 10,800 mL delivered over 10-1/3 hours, fill volumes of 2400 mL, and 4 cycles. By peritoneal equilibrium testing, Mr. Barrientos Garcia is a low-average transporter.     On physical examination, the head and neck were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. The peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site was clean and dry.  Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower extremities were of slightly diminished muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.    Laboratory data were available from the Satellite Partners Information Network, having been collected on February 14. The BUN and creatinine were 33 and 10.54 mg/dL respectively. The serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate concentrations were 128, 4.3, 91, and 27 mmol/L respectively. The serum calcium, phosphate, and albumin concentrations were 8.8 mg/dL, 2.0 mg/dL, and 3.1 g/dL respectively, likely reflecting poor dietary protein intake. The hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL with an hematocrit of 32.3%. The leukocyte and platelet counts were 8205 and 157,000 per mcL, respectively, the latter likely reflecting chronic and ongoing inflammation and possibly iron deficiency. Urea kinetics demonstrated a total Kt/V urea of 1.99, comfortably above international clinical practice guideline targets. The residual kidney function (from 373 mL of urine), showed a creatinine clearance of 1.7 mL/minute per 1.73 sq m. The weekly residual Kt/V was 0.21 demonstrating that the bulk of solute clearance is coming from Mr. Barrientos Garcia's dialysis. The normalized protein nitrogen appearance was 0.7, suggesting adequate, but not excessive, dietary protein intake.     In summary, Mr. Ricardo Barrientos Garcia is a delightful 57-year-old Guatemalteco with end-stage kidney disease  associated with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with innumerable complications, particularly over the past 18 months. Most notably, severe refractory hypothyroidism, lymphadenopathy, and recent discovery by lymph node biopsy of systemic disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mr. Barrientos Garcia's condition is further compromised by multiple social determinants of health. When he arrived in the United States, he was working regularly. He has not been working over the past 1 to 1-1/2 years owing to a reduction in day labor hiring in the construction industry. He is a gentleman of a very modest means and has spent through virtually all his savings. He has been anxious to return to either Guatemala or El Salvador where he might obtain a kidney transplant at a lower price than what might be required should he stay in the United States. He has been separated from family for several years. He has been stably housed but has significant food insecurity.     I commend our facility social worker, Ms. Mari Regev, for creatively identifying resources to assist Mr. Barrientos Garcia.     With respect to more immediate issues, I spoke briefly with Dr. Contag during the latter half of Mr. Barrientos Garcia's visit. She has been working tireously to ensure that Mr. Barrientos Garcia receives his tuberculous therapy. I worry that Mr. Barrientos Garcia is attributing a variety of signs and symptoms due to his underlying health conditions to the RIPE therapy. I reminded him of the importance of maintaining adherence with his antituberculous therapy. Mr. Barrientos Garcia has visits arranged with Dr. Goldenberg next week and his new primary care physician, Dr. Mugdha Joshi, the Monday following.     Dr. Contag and I have were both very concerned about Mr. Barrientos Garcia's abdominal pain which could represent tuberculous ileitis or colitis or possibly a garden variety diverticulitis or typhlitis.     I requested  imaging in the next few days with CT abdomen pelvis with radiocontrast.     I also urged Mr. Barrientos Garcia to seek immediate care, either at Hoover Express Care or at Stanford Emergency Department, should he developed new fevers or worsening abdominal pain.     Thank you again for entrusting me with Mr. Barrientos Garcia's kidney disease and dialysis care.

At intake visit 4/8/2021, she was obviously short of breath but did not have any clear pulmonary etiology by PFTs or CT-PE.  Echo and ECG needed to confirm no cardiac etiology--> echo essentially normal done 8/5/2021.  Could be obesity hypoventilation given noncompliance with CPAP and OSA.  Also has a history of factitious disorder.     CAD: No     Arrhythmia: No     HTN: need recent value     Hyperthyroid: No     Substance use disorder: No     Glaucoma (phentermine contraindicated, <1% postmarketing case reports with topiramate): No     Pregnancy (REMS): OCP, rare spotting, no regular menses     Nephrolithiasis: No     Bupropion/Naltrexone: Prazosin            Medication interactions: Yes      HTN: need recent value     EtOH use: Yes  , within range     Opioids: No     Seizure hx: No     Glaucoma (<1% postmarketing case reports with bupropion):  No            Mood: as above/below     SI: Yes , at intake 4/8/2021 she reported occasional passive thoughts, last attempt 2 to 3 years ago, has safety plan which mother assists with by controlling medications and being her support, has crisis line number and says she would call.  However, 4/24/21 and 5/18/2021 she was brought into emergency department by ambulance with concern for self-harm.   4/24/2021 she had ingested 60 hydroxyzine stating she was trying to harm her self after getting into an argument with her sister.  5/18/2021 she got upset after an argument in a group program and made multiple statements about feeling suicidal.  In both instances she was released after calming down and being treated denying any continued interest in self-harm.  Part of this reaction has been attributed to her autism spectrum disorder and not knowing how to cope with difficulty.  Regardless, Contrave is not a good option for her.     GLP-1 agonist:           Currently limited by SI as mentioned above.  She also needs labs, current weight, and discussion about whether or not she is willing and able to take injection medication.     DM: Yes, Metformin only     Willingness to take shots: Not discussed     Pancreatitis hx: No     Cholelithiasis: No     Triglyceride: Needs labs     Liver function/Renal fx (limited data in ESRD, severe LD): Needs labs     Gastroparesis: No     SI: Yes, see above      Family hx of endocrine cancers: No     Metformin: Prescribed 2 g daily, previously increased from 1 g daily for additional weight management benefit.  Hemoglobin A1c 6.4% 8/5/2021    ============================================================        Addressed at prior clinic visit, not updated today:     #Class III Obesity  -Weight/BMI at intake 4/8/2021: 325 pounds / 48 kg/m²   -Reasons for desire to lose weight: gain mobility back, fit into clothes, """"it's hard, I also love food. I seem to have choose b/w my body and food""""  -Patients stated goal weight: """"ideally be normal BMI""""  - Highest/current adult weight at intake: 325 lbs at 27 yrs old (BMI 48 kg/m2); Lowest """"adult"""" weight: 130 lbs at 16 yrs old;  IBW: 146 #; EBW: (At intake weight 325 pounds) 179 pounds  -Weight history: Weight gain consistently over time since late teens.  Until pre-teen was """"skinny"""". First time she felt larger than usual was mid teens needing  large/XL pants, then lost to 130#, then started gaining, did get to 200+ got down to 180#, then has been gaining since.  -Previous weight loss efforts: diet and exercise, gains have been during """"relapses"""", typical diet has been Southern cooking, FHx paternal side obesity  -Most helpful in previous weight loss efforts: diet and exercise  - Medical/psychological/other causes of/contributors to obesity at intake include: inadequate physical activity, excess caloric intake, depression, PTSD, night eating, occasional MJ use, OSA, asthma, insomnia, poor sleep hygiene, LBP with walking  - Obesogenic medications at intake include: Gabapentin, prazosin, unclear if any contribution from OCP; conversely, metformin is associated with weight loss  - Obesity comorbidities at intake include: Some worsening of depression (+SI passive/h/o attempt 2+ years ago), DM2, OSA, likely contributor to asthma, GERD, LBP with walking, urinary incontinence    #Pulm:  #OSA:  #Asthma:  On video visit at intake 4/8/2021, she was noticeably SOB with talking or shifting position from lying to sitting. Not able to cook at home much 2/2 SOB. She said she¿d seen a pulmonologist at SMMC, but I didn¿t seen anything in the SMMC records about this.  Asked PCP to refer her to pulmonary if not done already--> no pulmonology visit as of 7/15/2021.  Ms. Harris did say she had asthma and OSA but what I saw was not typical of this. PFTs do not seem to correlate with symptoms (Normal spirometry study, normal lung volume, and mildly reduced diffusion capacities.  FEV1 is 2.88 L, 80% of predicted.). I wonder if she¿s developing OHS. She¿s not been adherent to CPAP.  Negative D-dimer so unlikely to be PE. She warrants cardiac workup if no obviously pulmonary cause of her SOB can be determined.  Thus far, echo essentially nl. EKG not completed (ordered previously at SHC and have also asked SMMC PCP to do.) Asthma has been flaring up while she is moving around her new  place more to unpacking things away.  She reports purchasing a""""portable oxygen enhancement system"""" herself because """"doctors did not think I needed it"""".  She shows me the device, but it does not have any of the typical settings of either portable supplemental oxygen or an oxygen concentrator.  There is just an indicator for time which he was set at 60 minutes.  There are no markings for liters of oxygen. Using albuterol daily at minimum 2-4 puffs, BID QVAR.  - pulmonology visit at SMMC recommended  -need ekg  -Again, encouraged adherence to CPAP    #Behavioral Health/Medicine: History of ASD/Aspergers, anxiety, depression, PTSD. Self-reports a question of factitious disorder per her prior conversations with her mental health care providers.  She was able to get through some college as her highest level of education.  She did need some assistance with learning throughout her school years.  Reports night eating and """"food addiction"""".  Substance use notable for occasional MJ and 1-2 alcoholic drinks per week.  At intake 4/8/2021 she had both a psychiatrist and therapist that she sees through San Mateo Medical Center.   Has recurrent SI/SA. Feels thoughts are more frequent lately (at 4/8/21 intake); dad recently passed away near beginning of pandemic which is a major stressor/source of bereavement for her.  - Last SA 4/24/2021, ingestion of 60 hydroxyzine.

Result can be falsely decreased in patients with elevated levels of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Metamizole.  [2] eGFR is consistent with normal renal function.   All estimates of GFR based on plasma/serum creatinine will be less accurate for patients with UNSTABLE CREATININE CONCENTRATIONS, at the extremes of body size or muscle mass, those with unusual diets, and those with conditions associated with reduced secretion or extrarenal elimination of creatinine.  [3] eGFR is consistent with normal renal function.   This eGFR is calculated for Non-African American patients.   All estimates of GFR based on plasma/serum creatinine will be less accurate for patients with UNSTABLE CREATININE CONCENTRATIONS, at the extremes  of body size or muscle mass, those with unusual diets, and those with conditions associated with reduced secretion or extrarenal elimination of creatinine.  [4] This is a borderline result for hemoglobin A1c. If the patient is a known diabetic, it indicates excellent recent glycemic control. If the test was ordered for screening purposes, it indicates impaired glycemic control with a high risk of developing diabetes in the near future.     [5] The reference range listed above is for a fasting patient.  Non-fasting glucose values may be higher.  [6] Result can be falsely decreased in patients with elevated levels of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Metamizole.  [7] The TSH result is produced from a reformulated method that is not significantly altered with biotin concentrations  up to 1200 ng/mL in blood.     [8] Patients with coronary heart disease or diabetes should target <100 mg/dl (or lower) as desirable level.     [9] Result can be falsely decreased in patients with elevated levels of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Metamizole.  [10] Result can be falsely decreased in patients with elevated levels of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Metamizole.  [11] Optimum levels in the normal population are 25-80     [12] Screening for IgA antibody to tissue transglutaminase (TTG) is performed using fluoroenzymeimmunoassay. This specimen was negative, consistent with a level of <8 U/mL. IgA anti-TTG may be negative in a patient with selective IgA deficiency.

Reading Physician:                          Michael McConnell, MD  on 08/05/2021 03:48 PM   Performed By: Sofia Lim  ============================================================  Assess/Plan 1/20/2022:  Chanel E Harris is a 28 Y year-old female with Class III Obesity, depression (+SI passive/h/o attempt 2+ years ago), anxiety, PTSD, ?factitious disorder (mentioned by patient), Asperger's with learning difficulties, night eating, occasional MJ use, DM2, OSA, asthma,  insomnia, poor sleep hygiene, GERD, LBP with walking, urinary incontinence, diarrhea of unclear etiology after eating, BC: OCP   was seen today via video visit (in lieu of in-person visit due to   the COVID-19 pandemic) for weight management in the Bariatric Surgery & Medical Weight Loss Clinic.     #Obesity, Class III  #DM2  - Most recent weight is 319 lb, BMI 46 kg/m2  - This is  Up 8 lb since last documented weight 1 month ago. Weights have been challenging to track due to no having them provided at all visits.   - Given suicide attempts last year x2, she was instructed to review a list of weight loss medications with her psychiatrist prior to prescribing any since all reasonably effective FDA approved options have a risk of mood changes.   - Metformin, which she's been on at the 1000mg/day dose was increased to 2000mg today to aid in further weight mgmt (last hbA1c is 6.4% 8/21)  - Best weight mgmt option from a medical would be a GLP-1 agonist, in particular semaglutide, since she has diabetes and obesity.  However, this is contraindicated in the setting of suicidal ideation or attempts.  I would defer for her psychiatrist to weigh in on this.  Her echocardiogram is also normal as have her PFTs.  She would still need an EKG and accurate/current blood pressure on file to consider Qsymia as well as psychiatry approval.  Given agitation and anger previously in the setting of suicide attempts, Contrave seems like a less good option for her, but again I defer to her psychiatrist.  Orlistat is not a good option for her given vitamin D deficiency and inability to follow recommended diet due to cultural food traditions, learning disability, and food insecurity.  - Psychiatrist is Dr. Chrisasamo (sp?), prescribes prozac feels OK on this, no SI/SA since last attempt in 2021, follows up every couple months per her report, has a peer counselor every couple weeks, sees a family therapist weekly with her mother, no  psychologist individally however  -Diet:Now eating 1-2 meals per day (previously 3/day), trying to eat healthier, still lives with mom  Previously reported a Southern diet made it difficult to eat healthy, when asked for specific changes did not list any. Doesn't feel dieting is helping.Has seen RD in interim 12/23/21 VLCD group with Shirley Siu.  She does not think this is a good plan for her.  Also had an individual appointment for medical nutrition therapy.  At this visit, we recommended consistent mealtimes, 1 protein supplement meal replacement  -Sleep: Recommendations as below.  Notably, she is not adherent to CPAP because she stays up watching videos on her devices which require her to wear her glasses.  She then falls asleep watching the videos and forgot to put on the CPAP.  She typically uses her CPAP a couple times a week.  CPAP adherence recommended.  - Physical activity:-Mobility is significantly limited by shortness of breath deconditioning and low back pain.  She is able to move around the house without a mobility device, but does have to use a 4 wheeled walker with seat to walk around outside the home and uses a wheelchair for any errands. Low back pain mainly bothers her after doing some walking.  She does not endorse radiculopathy.  -She is also interested in bariatric surgery and has an upcoming appointment with Dr. Azagury.     #Care coordination  - PCP: Hing-Hernandez, Amanda L, NP (SMMC)  - Lab preference San Mateo Medical Center, Daly city.  - Most care received at San Mateo Medical Center, Daly city.  -Psychiatrist:  Dr. Chrisasamo (sp?), follows up every couple months per her report, has a peer counselor every couple weeks, sees a family therapist weekly with her mother, no psychologist individally.    General recommendations:    #Diet  - For improvement in weight loss/management, general health, and most metabolic diseases, the diet should focus on the following foods: vegetables, whole  fruits, whole grains (ideally still in grain form, i.e., minimally-processed), legumes, and plant-based and lean proteins. Foods to minimize or eliminate include added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages, highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods, ultraprocessed foods, junk foods, red and processed meat. Calcium can be obtained from plant foods above or 2-3 servings of dairy or plant-based dairy alternatives.   - Dietary counseling addressed with RD, in Medgroups 2-4, or as applicable in 1:1 appts; they were encouraged to participate in the RD medically supervised weight loss program and/or the Medgroup program if applicable.    #Sleep:  - 7-8 hours of continuous sleep is recommended on a regular schedule for optimal health as well as weight loss/maintenance.   - If you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, it is important to follow recommendations to treat sleep apnea since untreated sleep apnea causes increased appetite, weight gain, and other medical problems like heart disease and diabetes.  - Medgroup1 discussion addresses optimal sleep, common disruptions, importance of treating medical and psychiatric conditions that may interfere with sleep, importance of good sleep hygeine, avoidance of blue light devices and ETOH within 2 and 3 hrs of sleep, respectively. They were encouraged to participate in the Medgroup program if applicable.  - Otherwise, as above     #Physical activity:  ¿ Recommended levels of physical activity for heart disease prevention and weight maintenance are 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity (like brisk walking or swimming), or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity (like jogging), aerobic activity.   ¿ Recommended physical activity for weight loss is 300 minutes per week of moderate intensity, or 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity, aerobic activity.   ¿ Everyone should do strength training of all major muscle groups two times weekly. One time would  include 8-12 repetitions and 2 sets. Body weight and resistance band exercises are included in this category. It is OK if you don't have weights or access to a gym.  ¿ Aerobic activity can be broken up into many episodes, such as several 10-minute episodes of activity throughout the day.   ¿ It's OK to start below these levels and work up. Activity will get easier as you get more fit.   ¿ If you have chest pain, severe shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting, please stop exercise, and contact your medical professional before continuing to exercise. Consider going to the emergency department for evaluation especially if symptoms don't stop when you stop exercising.   ¿ If you have difficulty with walking or balance, joint or other chronic pains, ask your medical provider about referral to physical therapy or other services that can help with these issues.   - This is addressed in detail in the Medgroup program and they were encouraged to participate if applicable.     #Mental and Behavioral Health:   -Many people with overweight and obesity also have symptoms of anxiety, depression, history of traumatic experiences, other mental health concerns, or eating for reasons other than hunger (like eating when stressed or in need of comfort) or have had eating disorders. Others take medications for mental health conditions that can cause weight gain. Alcohol intake and marijuana use can also cause weight gain; if you have difficulty controlling use of these substances, mental health providers can help. Most people aiming to lose weight would benefit from an assessment from a behavioral medicine specialist to address psychological and behavioral factors related to factors important for weight management such as dietary consumption, physical activity, pain, sleep, stress, substance use, and relationships/support.   -It is important for weight loss to make sure you have mental health care with a therapist, psychologist, and/or  psychiatrist, if needed. If any mental health conditions are present or suspected, evaluation by a psychiatrist and/or therapist is recommended. If ongoing care if recommended during the assessment, management of mental health conditions can aid in achieving weight management goals. If you have questions, please ask your medical provider at your next appointment.   - Brief introduction to behavioral medicine and brief intervention is conducted in Medgroup2; they were encouraged to participate if applicable.  - Otherwise, as above      See prior Stanford Bariatric Surgery and Medical Weight Loss Clinic notes for additional details of weight management plan and history.    Pt was encouraged to email me via MyHealth or call the clinic at any time with any concerns or questions regarding their weight loss or weight loss medication. For urgent needs they were encouraged to seek assistance via urgent care, primary care, or the ED as appropriate.    I personally spent a total of 50 minutes which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.

Other relevant medical history: anxiety, depression. OCD, ARFID-like food tendencies; on Stelara and recently tapered off of Uceris. History of severe malnutrition that has been gradually improving with increases in PO intake and more openness about food choices, as well as increased awareness around appetite and hunger over past the few months. Since the last encounter, has been going through a variety of life transitions, which  has impacted Avery's anxiety in general and as it relates to food and food choices. He's working on getting connected with a local therapist. Reports falling into """"thought traps"""" of not eating, not eating well, and then feel anxious about this. We discussed that some food is better than no food, that it's okay to want comfort foods in times of stress, and that this is a biological response and very normal, and that with more emotional health support, food choices may feel easier. Also discussed optimizing snacks for physical activity and other barriers to eating.    Avery's weight has been fluctuating between 115-119 lbs per reported. Exercising regularly and being active has helped with improving appetite and intake.     In general Avery prefers not to have number oriented goals (for example additional calorie goals per day, or weight gain goals per week) as he shared that he tends to have obsessional tendencies around food and numbers, he denies feeling like he has an eating disorder that is body image oriented but that this is more related to his OCD tendencies, which he is working on with a therapist.     NUTRITION GOALS:  KCals: ~47-54 kcal/kg (for high physical activity) + 500 kcal/day for weight gain needs  Protein: 0.8-1gm/kg  Fluids: 1mL/kcal (adult)    MALNUTRITION SCREENING:  Severe chronic malnutrition, gradually improving    NUTRITION DIAGNOSIS:     Altered GI function related to IBD/IBS as evidenced by GF diet - ongoing.     Inadequate energy intake related to recent flare as evidenced by past unintentional weight loss - improving    RECOMMENDATIONS/INTERVENTIONS/MONITORING:    1. Some food is better that no food! Remember your body is just seeking comfort during this challenging adjustment. There is nothing wrong with that.     2. When you feel like your blood sugars are low, it is very smart to eat a quick snack to help make you feel calmer and able to make a more substantial meal    3. Add a snack  15-30 min before your practice - fruit, half a bar, crackers to help you get through your practice.     4. This RD to talk to IBD SW about college dining accommodations.     5. Check in 4-6 weeks for RD only follow up.    6. Continue with weight checks every 1-2 months.    7. Plan for regular follow ups q1-2 months per Avery's request.    8. Continue multivitamin.    9. Goal to continue weight restoration  To previous UBW of 120-125 lbs.    Total visit time was 45 minutes via telehealth and this time was spent in education, counseling, and answering questions.

Identified with Nutritional Risk Factor: Decreased Food Intake  for More Than 5 Days. Current Nutrition Orders: Bariatric Surgery Full Liquid diet (not  appropriate, this diet order is for acute post-op period  following bariatric surgery) Nutritional Assessment: Diet History: Met with pt at bedside to obtain nutrition history.  Pt reports he is currently homeless and has been staying at Life  Moves housing shelter in San Mateo since January 4th. He reports  this shelter serves 3 meals per day, but reports he only eats 1  meal per day since his bariatric surgery in 2016. He reports the  food available to him is donated and does not always appeal to  him; or is not always something he is able to tolerate (ie.  cannot tolerate spicy foods such as curry). He also states that  since his bariatric surgery in 2016, he cannot tolerate acidic  foods or room temperature/lukewarm liquids without vomiting. This  has been difficult to manage because he is not allowed to keep a  fridge or cooler in the housing shelter where he stays and does  not often have access to cold liquids, so he typically does not  drink much fluid. He reports he could likely tolerate hot liquids  such as coffee or tea, but does not frequently drink these  beverages. He states that although he has EBT he cannot use it  much because he cannot cook or store perishable foods at Life  Moves. Reports his one meal per day consists of varying foods  such as burgers and fries or an egg sandwich. Per pt report,  intake PTA likely meeting <50% estimated needs.

The following risk factors increase her acute risk state: reporting current SI, acute psychosocial stressors (recent break-up, recent domestic violence, recently living on her own), endorses hopelessness    Meanwhile, the following protective factors diminish her acute risk state: lack of psychosis, therapeutic alliance and engagement, medication adherence, willingness to engage in suicide safety planning    Risk was further mitigated by the following interventions during this encounter: psychopharmaceuticals, brief supportive therapy, recruitment of social supports, arranged clinical follow-up, inpatient hospitalization    Risk Status (Chronic Risk)  The patient's chronic risk status is elevated above that of the general population, similar to that of typical patients on the inpatient service due to the following risk factors: chronic depression, personal hx of attempts    Adapted from:   - Pisani, AR et al. Reformulating Suicide Risk Formulation: From Prediction to Prevention, Acad Psych, 2016;40:623-629  - American Psychiatric Association's guidelines for suicide risk assessment  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention risk factors for suicide,  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/riskprotectivefactors.html  - Van Orden, KA et al.

Assessment of imminent risk of violence at this time: LOW-to-MODERATE  Assessment of chronic risk of violence at this time: MODERATE-to-HIGH    Narrative Assessment:  Ms. Devrani Laskar is a 19-year old female patient with history of eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), anxiety and depression with multiple suicide attempts during adolescence, presenting with symptoms of worsening depression, as per recommendation of her therapist.      On our assessment, patient endorses depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, and guilt, fatigue, wishes not to be alive as well as poor appetite and unintentional weight loss, consistent with episode of Major depressive disorder. Additionally, patient has exposure to childhood trauma and exhibits symptoms of sensitivity to rejection, mood lability, impulsivity, negative cognitions, consistent with complex PTSD. Given that patient states that weight loss was unintentional, it is not clear whether eating disorder is overlapping with current presentation/contributing to presentation, so evaluation upon hospitalization would be beneficial.      With respect to safety, she endorses passive SI (wishes not to be alive) that are chronic in nature and as of recently more frequent. However, she denies intent or plan to act upon her thoughts.     Given the patient's current psychiatric state, despite outpatient follow-up, and inability to safely discharge patient from SHC, the patient's condition warrants inpatient psychiatric admission for stabilization, evaluation, treatment adjustment, and transitional care planning. The patient is willing to come into the hospital on a voluntary basis. If the patient requests an unplanned or AMA discharge,  they will require an urgent psychiatric safety evaluation prior to their departure.

HPI:   History obtained from patient and chart review.    Patient presented to SCVMC ED on 4/17/2018 reporting 2 weeks of falls, left hip pain and left leg swelling. No documentation of any other symptoms patient may have had and he says he doesn't really remember. But does say he doesn't think he was having any fevers, chills or sweats. CT A/P was done showing splenomegaly, diffuse LAD with encasement of L femoral vein, likely causing his lower extremity edema. He was referred for FNA biopsy which was done 5/1/18. Report states negative but documentation from provides says the sample was inadequate. Patient was then unfortunately lost to follow-up.     He currently lives in his car, and has been for the past 3 months. He was brought in the ED tonight by a friend because of several days of left arm pain. Patient says his arm hurts because he has been sleeping on his L side and arm for the past several days. No trauma. Feels some radiation down his forearm. When asked about why he did not follow-up at SCVMC, he says he felt """"neglected"""" and did not like it there. Since last being seen, he has lost 30-40 pounds despite eating at Jack in the Box every day. Denies any food insecurity. Denies any fevers, chills, sweats. No cough or chest pain. No nausea or vomiting. Does have some mild L sided  abdominal pain. Denies constipation, diarrhea or melena. No dysuria or hematuria. Denies any bleeding. His lower extremity swelling has gotten much worse, and now also has RLE swelling, though less than the L. Feels very weak and has trouble getting around because of the swelling and weakness. No recent travel. He is glad he is here and wants to find out what is happening to him that is making him lose weight and feel so weak.    In ED:  On arrival afebrile with T 37.1, HR 90s, BP 150s/60s, satting 98% on RA. No imaging obtained. Noted to have wounds with possible cellulitis on RLE and sacrum. Blood cultures collected, given vancomcyin and zosyn and admitted to medicine for further work-up and treatment.     PMH:  Per HPI    PSH:  Per HPI    SOCIAL HISTORY:Allen V Schuhe was born at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City. Not close with any family. Has been homeless for several years. Previously in shelters, currently living in car for latst 3 months. Used to work as tradesman, doing electrical work and construction. Uses smoked meth. Denies any prior IVDU. Used to drink heavily but has been sober for 13 years. Current smoker, 50 pack year smoking history. No recent sexual activity. Has been active in past, female partners only. Inconsistent condom use.     FAMILY HISTORY:  Denies any family history of malignancy. Mother died of MS he believes. Not sure about his father's medical history.

There is a slight lambda-predominance in the large cell  gate; however we favor these events to represent B-cell aggregates,  with artifactual skewing towards lambda light chain.    EKG: NSR, PR 204, QTc 436, no q-waves, no e/o ischemia      Imaging:  SCVMC CT A/P with contrast 4/17/18:  Lower chest: Mild centrilobular emphysema in the lower lungs. Mild dependent atelectasis in the right lung base.  Liver: Mild diffuse hepatic steatosis.  Gallbladder:  Contracted.  Biliary tree: No biliary dilation.  Pancreas: No mass. No ductal dilatation.  Spleen: Splenomegaly.  Adrenals: No mass or hyperplasia.  Kidneys: Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with delayed nephrogram. The left ureter is encased at multiple sites by adjacent lymph nodes. Normal appearance of the right kidney.  Bowel: Moderate stool throughout the colon. Normal right lower quadrant appendix.  Bladder: There is moderate diffuse bladder wall thickening.  Reproductive organs: The prostate and seminal vesicles are markedly enlarged and not well delineated from conglomerate lymphadenopathy  in the pelvis.  Peritoneal cavity: There is diffuse mesenteric stranding. No free air or free fluid.  Vessels: There is marked compression and encasement of the left common iliac vein by conglomerate lymphadenopathy.  Lymph nodes:  - There is massive conglomerate lymphadenopathy involving the left external and internal iliac chains extending into the retroperitoneum. Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present to the level of the adrenal glands, and posterior mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also present. Abnormally enlarged lymph nodes are also present along the right external and internal iliac chains.  - Enlarged mesorectal lymph nodes are also present.  - Multiple abnormally enlarged lymph nodes up to 2.1 cm are present at the left inguinal region. Prominent right inguinal nodes up to 1.1 cm are also noted.  Soft tissues:  Bony Structures: There is a nonspecific 0.9 cm lucency in the left L1 superior facet. A 0.6 x 0.9 cm lucency is also present in the L2 vertebral body. Another lesion is present in the L5 superior endplate that appears more aggressive than typical for Schmorl?s node. Nonspecific heterogeneous appearance at the anterior L4 vertebral body. Some degenerative changes are present in the visualized spine.    1. The abnormal left common femoral vein waveform is likely due to marked encasement and narrowing of the left common iliac vein by lymphadenopathy.  2. There is conglomerate lymphadenopathy within the pelvis that is not well separated from the prostate and seminal vesicles. Lymphadenopathy is also present in the posterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and bilateral groins. Given concurrent splenomegaly, favor lymphoma, although metastatic disease is also possible.  3. There is moderate left hydronephrosis with delayed renal enhancement. The left ureter is encased by adjacent lymph nodes at multiple sites.  4. Moderate diffuse bladder wall thickening.  5. A few lesions are also present in the  spine as described above, suspicious for metastatic disease. No evidence of acute fractures or dislocation.    SCVMC Xray spine 4/17/18:  CONCLUSION:  Alignment is within normal and unchanged. Diffuse relatively mild degenerative spurring similar. Progression of disc space narrowing at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1. Bone changes seen on the CT scan performed subsequently are not as well visualized on the plain films.    SCVMC Xray pelvis 4/17/18:  CONCLUSION:  No acute fracture or dislocation. Approximate 2 cm cyst in the lateral left femoral neck.    SCVMC CT Neck 9/7/16:  CONCLUSION: 1. Left parotid lipoma again noted. The size and appearance  are stable to prior imaging from 1/12/2012.  2. Severe ethmoid and mild maxillary sinus disease.  3. Dental disease.        Assessment and Plan:    Allen Schuhe is a 59 yo homeless M with history polysubstance abuse (meth, tobacco), adult ADHD, L parotid lipoma, anxiety, chronic back pain s/p L5-S1 surgery (on methadone), diffuse lymphadenopathy/splenomegally (negative work-up to date at SCVMC), presenting with failure to thrive, weight loss, lower extremity edema and L sided pain, concerning for lymphoma vs metastatic disease of unknown primary vs chronic infection/inflammatory disease.    #L sided abdominal pain:  #Vertebral body lesions:   #Splenomegally:  #Diffuse lymphadenopathy: Patient has had over one year of diffuse lymphadenopathy with associated weight loss, weakness and failure to thrive. On exam he is cachetic and frail appearing. He had a negative FNA and non-specific flow cytometry of L inginal lymph node 5/2018, however, per notes there was question about adequacy of sample. He was unfortunately lost to follow-up after this. Presenting to ED today with ongoing decompensation. His presentation remains most concerning for lymphoma or metastatic malignancy of unknown primary, with prior imaging showing LAD of pelvis, mediastinum, retroperitoneum; splenomegaly and lesions  of vertebral bodies concerning for possible metastatic disease. Lymphoma of particular concern with his associated anemia, lymphopenia which could suggest bone marrow involvement. Spine lesions could suggest prostate source. Extensive smoking history so at risk for lung cancer. No hematuria making bladder, renal less likely. He is not up to date with age-recommended cancer screening and previously had positive FIT test. Amyloidosis less likely without clear evidence of other organ system involvement, but did have slightly increased lambda on flow cytometry previously. Chronic infection remains a concern. He is lymphopenic and has never been tested for HIV or syphilis. Could have disseminated TB or non-TB mycobacteria. Chronic fungal infections including cocci also on differential. He denies any fevers, joint pains, chest pain, shortness of breath or other symptoms that strongly suggest inflammatory disease, however sarcoid and SLE remain possible. Needs further imaging and lab evaluation and likely excisional lymph node biopsy and possibly bone marrow biopsy.   - ESR, CRP, TSH  - HIV screen, syphilis screen  - HBV, HCV screen  - QuantGOLD  - PSA  - FIT test  - SPEP/UPEP/free light chains  - Blood cultures  - CT chest, abdomen, pelvis with contrast  - Consider general surgery consult in AM for excisional lymph node biopsy  - Consider heme consult for bone marrow biopsy given hypoproliferative anemia and lymphopenia  - Inpatient vs outpatient colonoscopy  - Pending results of above may need inpatient vs outpatient PET  - Nutrition, PT, OT consults  - Social work consult to help with outpatient resources, homelessness, follow-up plans.    #Lymphopenia:  #Hypoproliferative anemia: Absolute lymphocyte count of 450. Will need to r/o HIV in patient who has never been previously tested. Could also be 2/2 sepsis though patient does not appear to be. Chronic infection could potentially cause. Anemia is hypoproliferative with  reticulocyte index of 0.64. In setting of LAD and concern for lymphoma, concern for possible infiltrate bone marrow process. Could also be due to chronic infection or inflammatory process however. Iron studies mixed, with low iron but high ferritin, suspect likely both iron deficient and chronic inflammation also contributing to anemia. No e/o hemolysis an denies any bleeding.  - HIV as above  - trend CBC BID  - Type and screened, consented for blood  - Transfuse for Hgb <7  - FIT as above  - Holding iron repletion pending infectious work-up    #Leukocytosis: WBC of 14 with neutrophilic predominance and bandemia. Concerning for infection with potential sources including cellulitis, intraabdominal or bacteremia. UA bland. Overall low suspicion for sepsis in absence of fevers, but will cover with antibiotics for now, at minimum to treat cellulitis. Suspect more likely related to chronic malignancy, inflammatory or infectious condition causing above.  - follow-up blood cultures  - MRSA nares  - continue vancomycin (2/6-current)  - continue zosyn (2/6-current)    #Cellulitis of R foot, sacrum: Patient's mobility greatly limited and reports spending extensive amount of time laying on L side in car. Has wounds to sacrum and R foot (pictures in media tab). Both have surrounding erythema, some purulence, concerning for cellulitis. Will some possible purulence will cover for MRSA. No tracking to deeper tissues or bone, but elevated inflammatory markers could suggest a deeper infection such as osteomyelitis. Denies any infectious symptoms, has been afebrile and HDS here.  - vanc/zosyn as above  - wound care consult    #L>R lower extremity edema: Severe lower extremity edema, L>R. Chronic and has always been worse on the left. Almost certainly the result of his extensive LAD, with prior imaging showing encasement of L femoral vein. Suspect has likely progressed to involve the R side more as well. Low albumin and potentially  heart failure could also be contributing. Has extensive venous stasis skin changes and poor hygiene.  - negative DVT US in ED  - skin hygiene/wound care  - pending results of CT will see if patient may benefit from potential intervention such as venous stenting    #L arm pain: patient reports acute L elbow pain, some radiation to forearm, thinks caused by laying on his L elbow for days in his car. Range of motion limited by pain. No appreciable effusion but erythema over olecranon. No overlying wounds but could be cellulitic. Given his malnutrition and unclear systemic disease, could have a fracture or lytic lesion potentially causing his pain. Could have some ulnar neuropathy with his forearm pain.  - plain films     #elevated NT-proBNP: Patient without known history of heart failure. No clear clinical syndrome of heart failure, though assessment limited by patient's severe lower extremity edema, weakness and deconditioning. No known history of CAD and EKG without q-waves or evidence of prior ischemia. At risk for nonischemic cardiomyopathy from meth use. Also possible he has a cardiomyopathy 2/2 his undiagnosed underlying systemic process which could include sepsis, amyloid, sarcoid among others.

Now with PET CT evidence of local recurrence in the R major fissure and R hilum -- he presented to the ED with complaints of DOE and CP.    Chief Complaint: DOE, CP    Oncology/Hematology History     Adenocarcinoma of right lung (CMS-HCC)     Start Date   End Date      4/22/2019  Initial Diagnosis     Adenocarcinoma of right lung (CMS-HCC)      9/8/2020  Cancer Staged     Staging form: Lung, AJCC 8th Edition  - Clinical: Stage IVA (cM1a) - Signed by Neal, Joel William, MD on 9/8/2020                8/30/08 - CT chest angiogram with 7mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.      12/14/16 - Chest x-ray with no masses.     11/8/18 - Presented to ED with chest pain. CXR with 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm nodule in the right middle lobe which is new compared with prior film of December 14, 2016. Also with cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis.     1/19/19 -  CT chest with 2.6 cm spiculated mass in the right middle lobe. No abnormal lymphadenopathy.      3/5/19 - Bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy of RML lesion, positive for well differentiated adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 low expression (1-2%), FISH negative for ALK and ROS1. Bronchial brush and bronchioalveolar lavage came positive for malignancy. Transbronchial needle aspiration form lymph node stations 7, 4R, 11R and 11L came negative. EGFR 19 del positive on STAMP.     3/20/19 - PET CT: Mild FDG uptake within right  middle lobe mass. Multiple mildly hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes are noted. The most prominent is seen within the left paratracheal station. Prominent increased uptake noted at the posterior aspect of the left ilium.      4/15/19 - SABR: RML treatment with Dr. Loo. 25 Gy in 1 fxn     7/25/19 - PET CT: Slightly smaller right middle lobe nodule closely associated with the oblique fissure with increased uptake and development of adjacent heterogeneous opacities suggestive of postradiation change. Nonenlarged moderately hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes with fairly symmetric distribution, likely reactive.     7/25/19 - CT chest: Decreasing size of the irregular pulmonary nodule in the lateral right middle lobe with increasing surrounding groundglass opacification and consolidation, favored to represent evolving postradiation change.     11/13/19 - PET CT: Increasingly focal area of radiotracer uptake in the treatment area of the right middle lobe remains indeterminate but is increasingly worrisome for residual/recurrent disease. There is also increased hypermetabolism and prominence of multiple mediastinal and hilar nodes.      11/13/19 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule.     2/4/20 - PET CT:  Interval decrease in hypermetabolism in prior treatment area in the right middle lobe reflects evolving post radiation inflammatory changes. There is interval decreased hypermetabolism and prominence of mediastinal and hilar nodes, with near-complete metabolic resolution, also reflective of decreasing inflammation.     2/4/20 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule. No evidence of recurrence.     2/19/20 - Stress TTE: Normal LV size and systolic function. LVEF by MOD=63%.      5/14/20 - CT chest:  Increased nodularity and increasing lobular margins of RML and RLL radiation change concerning for recurrence; minimal  enlargement of 3mm RLL nodule; new trace right pleural effusion     7/22/20 - PET CT: increased nodular uptake in the RML/RLL concerning for local recurrence; new small right pleural effusion with FDG uptake concerning for pleural disease; increased mild uptake of mediastinal and bihilar nodes favored to be inflammatory     8/4/20 - Tumor Board: PET CT findings are highly concerning for local recurrence of disease. Previous biopsy in 2019 revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion. As such, he is potentially a candidate for osimertinib. Recommend referral to medical oncology for consideration of systemic therapy. Given his advanced age and significant medical comorbidities, he is not a surgical candidate. There is also concern that CT-guided biopsy may cause complications. CT DNA evaluation may be considered, though imaging findings are consistent with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent disease.     10/01/20: ED evaluation for dizziness/SOB. CTA negative for PE, malignant pleural effusion is slightly worsened.      10/05/20: CT Chest - decreased size of a small right pleural effusion. Masslike consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower with involvement of the fissures; findings appear similar to 10/1/2020 recent comparison exam although progressed from more older exams and are consistent with disease recurrence at the site of prior radiation     12/29/20: CT chest -  Nodular consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower lobe and adjacent nodularity appear mildly increased from 10/5/2020 and more conspicuously increased from 5/14/2020. Increased small to moderate R pleural effusion.     HPI:   Patient reports that he has been experiencing worsening DOE over the last few days -- he reports that he ambulates unassisted at baseline, but over the last several days he has been noticing worsening SOB w/ exertion (does not use home O2), and ultimately called 911 for worsening symptoms. He has been coughing more over the  last few days -- reports he has inhalers at home, but does not use them very frequently. Denies any fevers or chills. He also endorsed some CP on presentation, but that has now subsided. He endorsees having a cardiac history and states that he """"sometimes"""" takes his coreg and aspirin, but he typically does not take all of his meds as he has """"too much"""" to keep track of. He reports he has been staying in a motel/inn and a friend brought over some pots and pans for him, but per the notes in his chart, it appears he has limited psychosocial support: he has a daughter in Louisiana and per patient, he has another daughter """"near Palo Alto."""" He reports he has had a poor appetite over the last several days -- did not eat at all yesterday. Denies any N/V or abdominal pain, but states he just does not feel hungry. Reports he has been drinking water and does frequency drink coca cola. No dysuria or hematuria, but reports his urine looks """"more yellow"""" over the last few days. He has regular BMs most days -- last was earlier today. He endorses some chronic shoulder pain and knee pain that is not bothering him currently. Was having bad headaches earlier in January of this year, but he reports those have now subsided -- he's not sure if he ever got the MRI brain he was instructed to get done by his oncologist, Dr. Neal. He otherwise offers no additional constitutional complaints.     A complete 14 point review of systems was obtained.  Pertinent positives and negatives are noted in the HPI. Otherwise, the reviews of systems were negative.

Now with PET CT evidence of local recurrence in the R major fissure and R hilum -- he presented to the ED with complaints of DOE and CP. Cardiac workup was largely negative. Plan to consult pulmonary in the morning for possible thoracentesis.      #DOE  CT angio done on admission showed no PE, but did show concern for disease progression and large ~1400cc R pleural effusion. He is not requiring supplemental oxygen at this time. Presuming that his SOB is in part due to R pleural effusion.

EKG showed LVH possibly causing some ST-depressions, however trop was negative x2. Underwent dobutamine stress echo on 2/10 that showed:   Normal resting wall motion and no stress-induced wall motion abnormality. The global left ventricular systolic function   improved after stress.   1. Protocol: Dobutamine 40 mcg/kg/min. There was no new ST segment depression. Arrhythmia induced during stress: occasional PAC's, and PVC's. Arrhythmia during recovery: frequent PVCs/bigeminy PVC's,   some couplet PVC's. The patient did not exhibit any symptoms during drug infusion. The patient exhibited a hypertensive response with stress, peak B/P 195/95 . Drug infusion was stopped due to   achieving target heart rate.   2. Normal LV size and grossly normal overall LV systolic function.   3. Compared to prior stress echo on 2/19/20, no significant change.

HPI:    Pt is a poor historian. Spoke with daughter, Eugenia for further history.    Pt has multiple recent admission for FTT and poor PO intake, most recently as of 9/20-9/22.     Pt was brought in today by EMS for increased weakness. Was scheduled to received IVF infusion today but this was deferred as daughter felt he should go to ED as he appeared much weaker and more confused than typical. Eugenia reported that he had a limited appetite, generalized weakness, and was complaining of worsening dizziness over the last several days.    On interview, pt unsure why is he is in the hospital. Stated he has not been eating much because he does not feel like he has tastebuds anymore and food is not appetizing anymore. Reports that he has not gotten out of bed since his last discharge and feels very deconditioned. Denies any infectious symptoms, CP, SOB, or pleuritic pain. Diarrhea improved over the past several weeks per pt.    Lives in VA housing, has a caregiver at home.

Oncology subsequently paged for admission.    Oncology history:    Summary: EGFR exon 19 del stage 4 non small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) of the right middle lobe s/p SABR treatment on 04/15/2019 (25 Gy in 1 fxn). Now with PET CT evidence of local recurrence in the R major fissure and R hilum. Currently on osimertinib, last oncology clinic visit 8/23/2021.      8/30/08 - CT chest angiogram with 7mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.      12/14/16 - Chest x-ray with no masses.     11/8/18 - Presented to ED with chest pain. CXR with 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm nodule in the right middle lobe which is new compared with prior film of December 14, 2016. Also with cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis.     1/19/19 -  CT chest with 2.6 cm spiculated mass in the right middle lobe. No abnormal lymphadenopathy.      3/5/19 - Bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy of RML lesion, positive for well differentiated adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 low expression (1-2%), FISH negative for ALK and ROS1. Bronchial brush and bronchioalveolar lavage came positive for malignancy. Transbronchial needle aspiration form lymph node stations 7, 4R, 11R and 11L came negative. EGFR 19 del positive on STAMP.     3/20/19 - PET CT: Mild FDG uptake within right middle lobe mass. Multiple mildly hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes are noted. The most prominent is seen within the left paratracheal station. Prominent increased uptake noted at the posterior aspect of the left ilium.      4/15/19 - SABR: RML treatment with Dr. Loo. 25 Gy in 1 fxn     7/25/19 - PET CT: Slightly smaller right middle lobe nodule closely associated with the oblique fissure with increased uptake and development of adjacent heterogeneous opacities suggestive of postradiation change. Nonenlarged moderately hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes with fairly symmetric distribution, likely reactive.     7/25/19 - CT chest: Decreasing size of the irregular pulmonary nodule in  the lateral right middle lobe with increasing surrounding groundglass opacification and consolidation, favored to represent evolving postradiation change.     11/13/19 - PET CT: Increasingly focal area of radiotracer uptake in the treatment area of the right middle lobe remains indeterminate but is increasingly worrisome for residual/recurrent disease. There is also increased hypermetabolism and prominence of multiple mediastinal and hilar nodes.      11/13/19 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule.     2/4/20 - PET CT:  Interval decrease in hypermetabolism in prior treatment area in the right middle lobe reflects evolving post radiation inflammatory changes. There is interval decreased hypermetabolism and prominence of mediastinal and hilar nodes, with near-complete metabolic resolution, also reflective of decreasing inflammation.     2/4/20 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule. No evidence of recurrence.     2/19/20 - Stress TTE: Normal LV size and systolic function. LVEF by MOD=63%.      5/14/20 - CT chest:  Increased nodularity and increasing lobular margins of RML and RLL radiation change concerning for recurrence; minimal enlargement of 3mm RLL nodule; new trace right pleural effusion     7/22/20 - PET CT: increased nodular uptake in the RML/RLL concerning for local recurrence; new small right pleural effusion with FDG uptake concerning for pleural disease; increased mild uptake of mediastinal and bihilar nodes favored to be inflammatory     8/4/20 - Tumor Board: PET CT findings are highly concerning for local recurrence of disease. Previous biopsy in 2019 revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion. As such, he is potentially a candidate for osimertinib. Recommend referral to medical oncology for consideration of systemic therapy. Given his advanced age and significant medical comorbidities, he is not a surgical candidate. There is also concern  that CT-guided biopsy may cause complications. CT DNA evaluation may be considered, though imaging findings are consistent with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent disease.     10/01/20: ED evaluation for dizziness/SOB. CTA negative for PE, malignant pleural effusion is slightly worsened.      10/05/20: CT Chest - decreased size of a small right pleural effusion. Masslike consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower with involvement of the fissures; findings appear similar to 10/1/2020 recent comparison exam although progressed from more older exams and are consistent with disease recurrence at the site of prior radiation     12/29/20: CT chest -  Nodular consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower lobe and adjacent nodularity appear mildly increased from 10/5/2020 and more conspicuously increased from 5/14/2020. Increased small to moderate R pleural effusion.      2/9-16/21: Hospital admission. Patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. 2/9 CTA chest was negative for PE, but did show an enlarged right pleural effusion and increased nodular consolidation in the right middle/lower lobe. He was also found to have 6 supratentorial brain metastases on brain MRI from 2/11. He had therapeutic thoracentesis with 1.5L removed and he was started on tagrisso 80 mg on 2/12/21. Evaluated by rad onc, but CK deferred to treatment response appreciated on sim scan on 2/15/21.      2/12/21: Started Tagrisso 80 mg daily      3/18-21/21: Hospital admission for AKI 2/2 volume depletion in setting of diarrhea, likely due to osimertinib. Infectious work-up negative. CT abdomen/pelvis unremarkable. AKI improved with fluids resuscitation. Osimertinib dose reduced to 80 mg every other day on discharge to SNF.     4/13/21: MRI brain - A new 4 mm enhancement in the right posterior temporal lobe. Overall treatment response for all other existing lesions.              CT chest - Decreased right middle/lower lobe mass,  with resolution of adjacent right middle lobe nodularity. Improved small to moderate volume right-sided pleural effusion.      4/14/21: saw Dr. Hayden (neurosurgery), previously considered CK for brain lesions but due to significant response with Tagrisso will follow with repeat MRI brain in 3 months     5/7/21: ECHO with normal LV/RV size and systolic function. LVEF 63%. MV prolapse with moderately severe MR (seen on previous ECHO)     5/21-26/21: Admitted from clinic w/ diarrhea, AoCKD and hyperkalemia. Tagrisso was held in setting of AKI. Diarrhea resolved spontaneously. He remained admitted to optimize K and Cr, which improved with IVF fluids and prn medications. Regarding his right ankle pain, 5/24 CT showed healing fractures on his R distal fibula and L 3rd/4th metatarsal. On discharge, K improved to 4.4 from 7.0, SCr improved to 1.72 from 3.5, and tagrisso re-started to 80 mg every other day. Discharged with home health services with plans for weekly labs.      7/12/21: MRI brain - Two previously-seen metastatic lesions have resolved or nearly-completely resolved. The right posterior parietal lesion has slightly decreased in size. The remaining lesions are stable.     7/14/21: CT chest wo contrast - Stable right middle/lower lobe mass and moderate right pleural effusion compared to 4/13/21, but decreased from 12/29/20.      8/23/2021: AKI 2/2 volume depletion in setting of diarrhea. Osimertinib dose reduced to 40 mg daily. Having intermittent dizziness.     9/20-22/21: Admission for pre-syncope after sitting in the sun for awhile. CT chest showed overall stable pleural effusion and RML/RLL mass. Thoracentesis was considered but deferred given stable appearance. Pt improved after IVF and discharged home.      10/15/21: CT chest - stable with slight increased in large R pleural effusion    Past Medical History:   Diagnosis Date   ¿ Benign prostate hyperplasia    ¿ Blindness     Right eye due to remote trauma    ¿ CAD S/P percutaneous coronary angioplasty    ¿ Chronic kidney disease    ¿ Exotropia of right eye 5/14/2015   ¿ Eye injury 1953    OD hit by coke bottle per patient   ¿ HTN (hypertension)    ¿ Hyperlipidemia    ¿ Mitral valve prolapse     with severe MR      Past Surgical History:   Procedure Laterality Date   ¿ BRONCHOSCOPY NAVIGATIONAL Bilateral 3/5/2019    Performed by Bedi, Harmeet Singh, MD at STANFORD HOSPITAL ENDOSCOPY   ¿ CATH CORS POSSIBLE N/A 8/12/2015    Performed by Tremmel, Jennifer Ann, MD at STANFORD HOSPITAL CATH LAB   ¿ CHEST TUBE INSERTION  3/5/2019    Performed by Bedi, Harmeet Singh, MD at STANFORD HOSPITAL ENDOSCOPY   ¿ COLONOSCOPY, POLYPECTOMIES N/A 9/4/2014    Performed by Becker, Laren S, MD at OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTER   ¿ EGD WITH BIOPSY N/A 5/22/2019    Performed by Garcia, Patricia Adriana, MD at STANFORD HOSPITAL ENDOSCOPY   ¿ EGD, BIOPSIES N/A 9/4/2014    Performed by Becker, Laren S, MD at OUTPATIENT SURGERY CENTER   ¿ HX HERNIA REPAIR     ¿ PCI N/A 8/13/2015    Performed by Tremmel, Jennifer Ann, MD at STANFORD HOSPITAL CATH LAB       Allergies   Allergen Reactions   ¿ Penicillins Nausea, Vomiting and Dizziness       Prior to Admission Medications   Prescriptions Last Dose Informant Patient Reported?

HPI:    Mr. Foote was in his usual state of health until April 2015 when he developed dizziness and nausea while helping a friend build a bed.  He presented to SUH ED and was admitted for chest pain with a negative ACS work-up.  Echo at that time showed MVP with flail posterior leaflet and severe MR. Labs at that time were also notable for mild, stable pancytopenia and CKD with baseline Cr ~1.3.  He was discharged on amlodipine.  Over the subsequent several months, he reported fatigue, lightheadedness, decreased exercise capacity, anorexia, and malaise.    In August 2015, he noted 3 days of substernal chest pain on exertion that never completely resolved with rest. The pain became more acute 8/12/15 and he presented to SUH ED where he was found to have an elevated troponin to 0.5 with ST elevations in V2-V3 and echo with new septal and apical wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiogram on 8/12/15 revealed complex 90% and 75% mid LAD stenoses as well as an 85% LCx stenosis.  He was placed on IABP while debating CABG, however family favored complex PCI.  On 8/13/15, he underwent PCI with successful placement of two overlapping DES to the mid LAD; LCx intervention attempted but unable to intervene. IABP removed s/p PCI without further complications. Pt discharged on dual antiplatelet therapy, carvedilol 3.125mg BID, lisinopril 10mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg qhs.    In the interim, he has followed up with Dr. Tremmel on 8/24/15 and with Dr. Schnittger on 9/17/15  and was thought to be doing well with no recurrent chest pain.  Since these visits, he has occasionally had chest pressure and mild shortness of breath on exertion that resolved quickly at rest but this did not greatly limit his activity.  Approximately 2 weeks prior to admission, his best friend died and he travelled to Stockton to stay with family. Per his report, he did not have all of his medications with him but is unclear which he has and has not been taking.  Over the past 3 days, he reports chest pain with less exertion than his baseline angina with no rest symptoms.      He presented to the SUH ED 12/14/15 due to these worsening symptoms.  EKG was unchanged and troponins were negative. He was admitted to the CDU for monitoring overnight and serial EKG and troponins, all of which were negative.  This morning, he developed substernal chest pain at rest similar to his prior NSTEMI. Cardiology was consulted for assistance in management of unstable angina.

Decision was made to transfer him to medicine for further obs/management.    Upon my interview, pt reports feeling back to normal. He said he walked around with physical therapy well without issues. He does report intermittent dizziness/lightheadedness at home, especially when standing up. Denies ever having problems with """"low blood pressure"""", said that he always has high BP on previous clinic visits. He has a BP cuff at home, and reports his pressures are usually in 90s/60s, sometimes over 100. Currently has no chest pain or difficulty breathing; last episode of exertional angina was a """"few"""" weeks ago, resolved with rest. Ran out of nitro at home. Pt could not remember what medicines he takes at home, but says he takes """"five or six heart meds"""". He said yes to Coreg and Imdur, but could not remember the dosing or how often he takes them. He lives with his girlfriend, who sometimes helps manage his medications, but pt typically does it on his own.

OTHER PERTINENT DATA REVIEWED AS PER EPIC    ASSESSMENT/PLAN  This is a 87 Y male with hx of mitral valve prolapse with severe MR, CAD s/p NSTEMI in 8/15 s/p DESx2, who follows Dr. Schnittger in Cardiology clinic, presenting with 1-week hx of cellulitis,  initially admitted to CDU and started on IV Clindamycin where he developed symptomatic hypotension and bradycardia (SBP 90s, HR 50s), now admitted to medicine for further management.     # Hypotension + bradycardia: SIRS in setting of infection vs. Blood loss (mild drop of Hgb 11.5-->9.5, however this is patient's baseline and likely came in dehydrated in setting of infection) vs. Iatrogenic (Coreg + Imdur -- pt reports symptomatic hypotension at home as well; reported to have low blood pressures during previous hospitalizations). EKG shows sinus bradycardia, otherwise at baseline. Over the last few years, seems to become less and less tolerant of antihypertensives.   - f/u orthostatic vitals  - q4h vitals, tele  - Hold Coreg and Imdur today -- Imdur does not have mortality benefit, and seems to be causing more harm than good at this stage.   - upon D/C: daily BP checks and quick PCP follow-up    # Cellulitis: non-purulent, started ~1 week ago. Was started on IV Clindamycin in the CDU. AF, VSS  - Transition to PO Keflex 500 q8h (renally dosed)  - continue PT    # CAD: s/p NSTEMI in 8/2015, DES x 2 to LAD. LCx was also occluded but could not be intervened upon. Finished 12 months of DAPT.  - Continue ASA 81  - HOLD Coreg for now given bradycardia.     # Severe MR: MVP with posterior flail leaflet. LVEF 57% on most recent TTE. Has mild symptoms (dyspnea on exertion, fatigue). Does meet criteria for MVR, however would be high risk given age and cardiac comorbidities.   - pt not interested in cardiac surgery on multiple previous discussions.     # CKD: presumably 2/2 HTN, no hx of DM. Was previously on lisinopril but this was discontinued due to hypotension.   - renally dose medications    #Prophylaxis/Other  VTE Prophylaxis: not necessary, short stay  Diet / MIVF:  Regular  Code Status Order: Full Code     #Sepsis screen [do not remove]:  No Data Recorded  #Nutrition screen [do not remove]:      Emergency Contact:    Extended Emergency Contact Information  Primary Emergency Contact: Oakley, Jamar  Address: 1160 Oconner St            EAST PALO ALTO, CA 94303 United States of America  Home Phone: 510-512-4723  Mobile Phone: 510-512-4723  Relation: Son  Preferred language: English  Interpreter needed?

HPI: Patient got dizzy and fell on 11/9/18, presented to Stockton ED and found to have right lung nodule incidentally.  Patient underwent chest imaging for chest pain with dizziness in Stockton ED on 11/9/18.  On that imaging, he was found to have a right lung nodule. Patient had also been having weight loss. Got dizzy and fell in Jan 2019, lung nodule incidentally identified on CT scan after fall. Underwent lung biopsy 3/5/19.       As you know, Mr. Eugene L Foote Jr. is a 88 Y male with history of mitral valve prolapse (with 3+ MR), HTN, HLD, CAD with NSTEMI 8/2015 s/p PCI with DES x 2 to LAD (8/2015, s/p 1 year ASA + plavix) and non-intervenable LCx. He has been followed by Dr. Schnittger for many years, and was last seen on 7/26/18 after a lengthy two year absence. At that time, we discovered that Mr. Foote's partner of several years had unexpectedly passed away, and that while grieving, he had neglected his self-care and was in a threatened housing status. Fortunately, his family members in the East Bay were able to care for him, and he presented for follow-up at that time. He unfortunately had not been taking his scheduled medications then, and we refilled them and requested he return for TTE and labs.     Today, Mr. Foote returns to clinic. He unfortunately missed his TTE because he was unable to get a ride from Stockton and had to drive himself,  running into traffic on the way. He is hypertensive to SBP 180s and notes that he forgot to take his medications this morning. He reports that otherwise, he is relatively compliant, and has only missed his medications twice this week.     On ROS, Mr. Foote reports that he does occasionally have exertional left-sided chest pain that resolves with rest. He otherwise has had no dyspnea or palpitations, and is able to ambulate on his own without a cane. He is concerned that his current diet is heavy in sodium and processed foods, and requests resources helping him eat healthier.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis 8/25/2014, PET/CT 7/22/2020 CTA chest to 9/20/2021 PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was  performed without IV or oral contrast. Dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 5.5. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 285. FINDINGS: Evaluation of the abdomen is somewhat limited by paucity of fat and lack of intravenous contrast. Lower thorax: Aortic valvular calcification. Small right pleural effusion, decreased from 2/9/2021 CT. Right middle and lower lobe post radiation changes. Previously seen right middle/lower lobe masslike consolidation is outside the field of view. Left anterior descending artery stent is partially visualized.  Liver and biliary tree: Normal noncontrast appearance. Gallbladder: Normal. Spleen: Normal noncontrast appearance. Pancreas: Normal noncontrast appearance. Adrenal glands: Normal noncontrast appearance. Kidneys and ureters: Redemonstration of bilateral renal cysts, the largest of which is a left parapelvic cyst measuring up to 4.6 cm. No hydronephrosis. No obstructing renal stones. Gastrointestinal tract: Evaluation limited due to lack of IV contrast. Moderate colonic stool and gas.. Fecalized material in nondilated small bowel loops. Peritoneal cavity: Redemonstration of fluid density focus inferior to the pancreas in the superior medial to the left kidney measuring 2.2 x 1.5 cm (3/48), unchanged. No free air. Nonspecific haziness of left omental fat. Bladder: Normal noncontrast appearance. Prostate and seminal vesicles: Normal. Vasculature: Redemonstration of abdominal aortic ectasia, measuring 3 cm at the diaphragmatic hiatus and 2.6 cm in the infrarenal aorta (3/68), previously measuring 2.3 cm. Right common iliac artery aneurysm measuring 2.0 cm, previously 1.5 cm. Left common iliac artery aneurysm measuring 1.6 cm, previously 1.5 cm. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the abdominal aorta. Lymph nodes: Normal. Abdominal wall: Tiny fat-containing umbilical hernia.  Musculoskeletal: Patient is cachectic. Partially visualized sclerotic focus of the right lateral eighth rib (3/1) unchanged when compared to CT chest 2/10/2021, but new when compared to CT chest 3/4/2019 and not hypermetabolic on 7/22/2020 PET/CT. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. Right iliac bone island. Mild degenerative changes of the spine.     IMPRESSION: 1.  Exam limited due to lack of IV contrast and paucity of intra-abdominal fat. No bowel obstruction. 2.  Small right pleural effusion, decreased from prior 2/9/2021 chest CT. The previously seen right middle/lower lobe pulmonary mass is outside the field-of-view. 3.  Redemonstration of infrarenal aortic ectasia measuring up to 2.6 cm and bilateral common iliac artery ectasia/aneurysms measuring up to 2.0 cm on the right and 1.5 cm on the left.

Unable to tell me how many times a day this is occurring. He also feels that it is mildly worsened with he takes a deep breath and with changing position. No nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Some dizziness with movement, esp standing/sitting up. Has not been eating/drinking well recently, reports feeling dehydrated. Last chest pain this AM but may have had some mild pain on arrival to ED. Denies current chest pain. Patient states that he cannot remember which medications he is on. He has coreg 6.25 mg BID, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, imdur 30 mg daily, and lisinopril 5 mg daily on his home med list. Per Dr. Schnittger's last note, she stated he had been taking coreg and aspirin at home. Has not been taking his home BP but reports it has been """"high"""" in the past (clinic blood pressures range 130-170s systolic). He reports he is due to hernia surgery tomorrow.     Patient was previously followed by Dr. Tremmel, more recently Dr. Schnittger. In 8/2015, patient presented with midsternal chest pain worse with exertion but never resolving. He presented to Stanford with trop 0.5, 4-5 mm ST elevations in V2-V3. Bedside echo demonstrated LV with new distal septal and apical hypokinesis, 3+ MR. He was taken to cath lab where severe and complex lesions were noted in LAD and LCx. After consultation with CT  surgery, patient had IABP implanted to augment coronary perfusion with plan to consider CABG vs complex PCI. Because patient and family expressed wishes to avoid surgery, he was taken to cath lab with PCI to LAD with two long DES successfully placed with good flow. LCx intervention was attempted but unable to cross wire due to anatomy.     He was hospitalized with unstable angina in 12/2015 when he presented with worsening exertional chest pain and chest pain at rest in setting of medication noncompliance. Troponins were negative and EKG showing baseline tall T waves in V2-V3, LVH without new changes. He was started on imdur with initial relief of symptoms. He underwent dobutamine stress echo showing no inducible ischemia.  It was felt that his angina was due to his non-intervenable LCx. Thus, he underwent medical management with imdur 30 mg daily.     ED Course:  In the ED, patient's vitals were BP 129/85, HR 77, sat'ing 96% on room air, afebrile. Troponin was negative x 2. EKG showed prior prominent appearing T waves in V2-V3. He was chest pain free. He received aspirin 325 mg, atorva 80, and imdur 30 mg with pressures remaining 120-130s all night. Bedside echo showed grossly normal EF without pericardial effusion, IVC ~1.5 cm and collapsible. He received 500 cc of NS.

Re-admitted in 12/2015 and successfully managed medically, felt to be in setting of medication noncompliance to home imdur. Current chest pain has some typical (worse with exertion) and atypical (positional) elements to story, but he does state it is new. From chart review, it appears his chest pain has usually presented at rest and more severely in the past, never resolving as it is currently. However, in general he is a poor historian. He does tell me he is currently chest pain free, but is unable to tell me when his last episode was. He currently appears comfortable. His EKG is at baseline, and his troponins are negative x 2. Could be demand related angina due to non-intervenable LCx in setting of hypertension at home, although he has no documented hypertension in the ED. He is unable to tell me what medications he is on at home, but admits to regularly missing his medications including aspirin, lisinopril, coreg and imdur. His BPs have been high in clinic, but he is normotensive here in the hospital and currently chest pain free.

HPI:     Patient presented for orthopedic clinic visit this afternoon for evaluation of right shoulder pain after a fall 2 months ago. At that time patient was feeling in his usual state of health. After the visit he was waiting out of doors for a ride, states he was sitting in direct sunlight for 40 minutes. Suddenly felt dizzy and weak, but denies loss of consciousness or fall/trauma. Did have an episode of NBNB emesis. Did not have breakfast prior to his orthopedic appointment but otherwise eating and drinking normally. Was brought to ED by EMS. Upon arrival to ED, stated he had already began to feel better.     Denies recent episodes of weakness or lightheadedness, denies other episodes of emesis. Denies abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fevers/chills, changes in vision, focal weakness. Has had recent unwanted weight loss related to his malignancy.    At his last oncologic clinic visit 8/23/2021, he was noted to be having intermittent dizziness, which was attributed to volume depletion in setting of diarrhea due to osimertinib therapy. Was encouraged to increase PO intake.     ED Events:  In the ED, CXR was notable for increased right pleural effusion and recent hemoglobin drop from 9.8 (8/23) to 7.9 (9/20). Recommended for admission due to ED concern for possible hemorrhagic effusion secondary to malignancy.     VS: HR  70s, afebrile, RR 18, BP 120/86, SpO2 100% on RA  Labs: WBC 4.4, Hg 7.9, Cr 1.41  Imaging: CXR with right pleural effusion and right basilar parenchymal opacity.  Treatments: LR 500ml     Oncology history:     Summary: EGFR exon 19 del stage 4 non small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) of the right middle lobe s/p SABR treatment on 04/15/2019 (25 Gy in 1 fxn). Now with PET CT evidence of local recurrence in the R major fissure and R hilum. Currently on osimertinib, last oncology clinic visit 8/23/2021.     8/30/08 - CT chest angiogram with 7mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule.      12/14/16 - Chest x-ray with no masses.     11/8/18 - Presented to ED with chest pain. CXR with 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm nodule in the right middle lobe which is new compared with prior film of December 14, 2016. Also with cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis.     1/19/19 -  CT chest with 2.6 cm spiculated mass in the right middle lobe. No abnormal lymphadenopathy.      3/5/19 - Bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy of RML lesion, positive for well differentiated adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 low expression (1-2%), FISH negative for ALK and ROS1. Bronchial brush and bronchioalveolar lavage came positive for malignancy. Transbronchial needle aspiration form lymph node stations 7, 4R, 11R and 11L came negative. EGFR 19 del positive on STAMP.     3/20/19 - PET CT: Mild FDG uptake within right middle lobe mass. Multiple mildly hypermetabolic mediastinal lymph nodes are noted. The most prominent is seen within the left paratracheal station. Prominent increased uptake noted at the posterior aspect of the left ilium.      4/15/19 - SABR: RML treatment with Dr. Loo. 25 Gy in 1 fxn     7/25/19 - PET CT: Slightly smaller right middle lobe nodule closely associated with the oblique fissure with increased uptake and development of adjacent heterogeneous opacities suggestive of postradiation change. Nonenlarged moderately hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal  lymph nodes with fairly symmetric distribution, likely reactive.     7/25/19 - CT chest: Decreasing size of the irregular pulmonary nodule in the lateral right middle lobe with increasing surrounding groundglass opacification and consolidation, favored to represent evolving postradiation change.     11/13/19 - PET CT: Increasingly focal area of radiotracer uptake in the treatment area of the right middle lobe remains indeterminate but is increasingly worrisome for residual/recurrent disease. There is also increased hypermetabolism and prominence of multiple mediastinal and hilar nodes.      11/13/19 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule.     2/4/20 - PET CT:  Interval decrease in hypermetabolism in prior treatment area in the right middle lobe reflects evolving post radiation inflammatory changes. There is interval decreased hypermetabolism and prominence of mediastinal and hilar nodes, with near-complete metabolic resolution, also reflective of decreasing inflammation.     2/4/20 - CT chest: Evolving post radiation changes to the right middle lobe nodule. No evidence of recurrence.     2/19/20 - Stress TTE: Normal LV size and systolic function. LVEF by MOD=63%.      5/14/20 - CT chest:  Increased nodularity and increasing lobular margins of RML and RLL radiation change concerning for recurrence; minimal enlargement of 3mm RLL nodule; new trace right pleural effusion     7/22/20 - PET CT: increased nodular uptake in the RML/RLL concerning for local recurrence; new small right pleural effusion with FDG uptake concerning for pleural disease; increased mild uptake of mediastinal and bihilar nodes favored to be inflammatory     8/4/20 - Tumor Board: PET CT findings are highly concerning for local recurrence of disease. Previous biopsy in 2019 revealed EGFR exon 19 deletion. As such, he is potentially a candidate for osimertinib. Recommend referral to medical oncology for  consideration of systemic therapy. Given his advanced age and significant medical comorbidities, he is not a surgical candidate. There is also concern that CT-guided biopsy may cause complications. CT DNA evaluation may be considered, though imaging findings are consistent with a clinical diagnosis of recurrent disease.     10/01/20: ED evaluation for dizziness/SOB. CTA negative for PE, malignant pleural effusion is slightly worsened.      10/05/20: CT Chest - decreased size of a small right pleural effusion. Masslike consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower with involvement of the fissures; findings appear similar to 10/1/2020 recent comparison exam although progressed from more older exams and are consistent with disease recurrence at the site of prior radiation     12/29/20: CT chest -  Nodular consolidation in the right middle lobe/right lower lobe and adjacent nodularity appear mildly increased from 10/5/2020 and more conspicuously increased from 5/14/2020. Increased small to moderate R pleural effusion.      2/9-16/21: Hospital admission. Patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. 2/9 CTA chest was negative for PE, but did show an enlarged right pleural effusion and increased nodular consolidation in the right middle/lower lobe. He was also found to have 6 supratentorial brain metastases on brain MRI from 2/11. He had therapeutic thoracentesis with 1.5L removed and he was started on tagrisso 80 mg on 2/12/21. Evaluated by rad onc, but CK deferred to treatment response appreciated on sim scan on 2/15/21.      2/12/21: Started Tagrisso 80 mg daily      3/18-21/21: Hospital admission for AKI 2/2 volume depletion in setting of diarrhea, likely due to osimertinib. Infectious work-up negative. CT abdomen/pelvis unremarkable. AKI improved with fluids resuscitation. Osimertinib dose reduced to 80 mg every other day on discharge to SNF.     4/13/21: MRI brain - A new 4 mm enhancement in the  right posterior temporal lobe. Overall treatment response for all other existing lesions.              CT chest - Decreased right middle/lower lobe mass, with resolution of adjacent right middle lobe nodularity. Improved small to moderate volume right-sided pleural effusion.      4/14/21: saw Dr. Hayden (neurosurgery), previously considered CK for brain lesions but due to significant response with Tagrisso will follow with repeat MRI brain in 3 months     5/7/21: ECHO with normal LV/RV size and systolic function. LVEF 63%. MV prolapse with moderately severe MR (seen on previous ECHO)     5/21-26/21: Admitted from clinic w/ diarrhea, AoCKD and hyperkalemia. Tagrisso was held in setting of AKI. Diarrhea resolved spontaneously. He remained admitted to optimize K and Cr, which improved with IVF fluids and prn medications. Regarding his right ankle pain, 5/24 CT showed healing fractures on his R distal fibula and L 3rd/4th metatarsal. On discharge, K improved to 4.4 from 7.0, SCr improved to 1.72 from 3.5, and tagrisso re-started to 80 mg every other day. Discharged with home health services with plans for weekly labs.      7/12/21: MRI brain - Two previously-seen metastatic lesions have resolved or nearly-completely resolved. The right posterior parietal lesion has slightly decreased in size. The remaining lesions are stable.     7/14/21: CT chest wo contrast - Stable right middle/lower lobe mass and moderate right pleural effusion compared to 4/13/21, but decreased from 12/29/20.     8/23/2021: AKI 2/2 volume depletion in setting of diarrhea. Osimertinib dose reduced to 40 mg daily. Having intermittent dizziness.

Legal Status: 5150 GD to expire on 11/13/10    History of Present Illness  53 yo spanish-speaking woman with history of depression was brought in to the ED by his brother after her mother decided not to let her live with her. Patient reported she has been depressed since his son's death 5 years ago. Recently, mother has told patient that she (mother) cannot take of the patient anymore because of her health issues. She visited Mexico for a week, and she became more depressed when she returned yesterday. When asked about how the trip went, she became tearful at that point. She refused to say what happened in the visit. She was living with her mother until last night, when mother decided not to let her live in the house. Patient stated that Her mother is sick. She got scared easily, and her mother was scared of her. She stated she has no other social support.   She endorsed feelings of depression, hopelessness, and helplessness, sleep disturbance, anhedonia, feelings of guilt, decreased energy, decreased concentration, decreased appetite. She denied suicidal ideation and any previous suicidal attempt. She endorsed being a chronic worrier but she denied to elaborate on that. She denied homicidal ideation. Denied AVH.   Per brother, she has become more depressed in the last 4 months. Yesterday, patient acted out and became violent at home. Patient was asked about contact phone number for her brother but she could not remember what it was.   Previous treatment modalities include:   antidepressants (patient does not remember what they are, when she was taking them but it was a while ago).   Interval Events:  Upon interview pt was found to be difficult to  interview. Long pauses between answers. Would not answer most questions. No eye  Contact.

HPI:  Bernardo Salazar was found to have altered level of consciousness while sitting in a wheelchair in the lobby of his dialysis center. He had been in his normal state during transport there. Just a few minutes later, he was found somnolent, responsive to pain. He was found to be hypoglycemic (POC blood sugar 48) and improved after receiving dextrose. After that, he was brought in and noted to be responsive, only feeling sleepy.     By the time our medical team met him, he was alert and oriented. He normally takes 10 units of Lantus and 3 units of Humalog with each meal. Today, he took 7 units Lantus, 3 units of Humalog, but did not eat breakfast as he thought he would. He relies on the food provided by the group house where he lives with 12 others. When the food is not healthy (e.g., fried food), he does not eat. Reports unreliable food source daily. Blurry vision when his glucose levels drop.    He also complained of itchy skin, everywhere. Every part of his body has been itchy for about one month. Itch is so intense that it has prompted him to consider suicide.     Functional Status/Independent of ADLs: Uses manual wheelchair to move around and lives in a home with 12 others.

She has tried ensure in the past and tolerates it but stopped because it was too expensive.  No issues swallowing or chewing, despite having no teeth (pulled 2/2 poor dentition/weak teeth as per patient).  She says the main reason she is not eating as much is because of the claudication pain she has in her buttocks, legs, calfs while preparing food.  She states that if someone is able to prepare the food for her should would eat much more.  She also said stress recently over her weight loss has caused her to eat less as well.

She was admitted most recently 8/18-8/27 for worsening lower back/pelvic pain and failure to thrive. She was discharged on a revised pain control regimen, per pain consult recommendations, including MS Contin 15mg TID, Oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN, gabapentin 600mg BID and 900mg QHS. Since discharge, she reports that her pain has not been well controlled at all. Pt wants to work with PT, but is still in the process of setting that up. Daughter complains that mother's pain is so poorly controlled on this regimen that she is """"not her usual self anymore."""" Pt lives with her daughter, who is primary caregivier, but denies caregiver abuse and feels safe at home. She was unable to f/u with PCP last week. She has refused colonoscopy in the past. She has chronic generalized weakness and 20lb wt loss over the last year. She has chronic urinary incontinence and constipation, which are stable.    She had mechanical fall on the morning pta and hit her L ribs on a coffee table. She presented to ED with new L rib pain as well as her chronic low back/pelvic pain, requesting pain management, including IV pain medication. She and daughter deny LOC, seizure-like activity, head trauma. In ED, she received 2mg IV dilaudid (despite pain  contract) and 5mg PO oxycodone.

Chief Complaint: Worsening lower back/pelvic pain, Failure to thrive    HPI:   Patient has complex medical hx though most notably has been suffering from chronic back pain of unclear etiology and failure to thrive over the past year, followed closely as an outpt by her PCP Dr. Artandi. Pt suffered mechanical fall onto R hip 8/1 and presented to ED where she was noted to have sacral insufficiency fractures. Ortho consulted and advised WBAT and pain control. She returned to the ED 8/2 c/o ongoing back and pelvic pain, MRI L-spine revealed no e/o of cord compression and she was discharged home. Pt presented again to ED 8/6 reporting similar back/pelvic pain, increasing difficulty ambulating and progressive generalized weakness. She was admitted 8/6-8/8 for failure to thrive and question of caregiver neglect at home. During that hospital stay, pt and daughter preferred home PT/OT rather than SNF, and pt was d/c'd home with rx for ensure, vitamin supplements, and PCP f/u. Pt presented again to ED 8/14 with persistent back pain, received dilaudid, then ultimately left and saw PCP same day where she was continued on oxycodone  20mg po q3 hr prn and gabapentin dose was increased. Pt had pain clinic appt schedule 8/19, though over the subsequent days had increasing back pain so came again to the ED.    Today pt reports severe low back and pelvic pain radiating to both legs while weight bearing, right leg worse than left, pain relieved when lying down. Pain has progressively worsened over the past 3-4 days, now unable to ambulate without assistance 2/2 pain. Also c/o progressive generalized weakness and wt loss (20 lbs over past year, 10-12 lbs in past 3 months, confirmed in epic), though states her inability to ambulate is 2/2 pain rather than weakness. Reports good appetite but unable to eat due to pain. Lives alone with daughter (primary caregiver) and believes daughter is """"overwhelmed"""" and unable to fully take care of her. Acknowledges financial limitations and cannot always afford food/supplements/ensure. Denies care-giver abuse and feels safe at home (answered with daughter not present). Denies nt sweats, abd pain, blood stools. Refused colonoscopy in past.  C/o chronic urinary incontinence though attributes to not being able to ambulate to bathroom in time. +constipation, though chronic on opiates. Denies recent seizure or new focal numbness or weakness. Pt understands the progressive nature of her symptoms and is willing to consider SNF placement.    In the ED, afebrile, VSS. CBC and BMP unremarkable. Pelvic XR with no new fractures. She received 3mg IV dilaudid (despite pain contract), 500 cc NS. Admitted to medicine for FTT and likely SNF placement.

INTERVAL EVOLUTION OF SACRAL INSUFFICIENCY FRACTURES.     Assessment/Plan   58 Y female with HTN, HLD, PAD, hx of SVT (on nadolol), seizure disorder (on keppra), mild COPD, current smoker,  chronic malnutrition and cachexia, chronic LBP, recent pelvic fracture s/p mechanical fall 8/1/13 with multiple ED visits and recent admission for FTT and pain control, discharged with home PT/OT, now re-presenting with persistent back/pelvic pain, difficulty ambulating and failure to thrive, likely needs SNF  placement for continued rehab.      # Failure to thrive: Likely multifactorial, though ongoing concerns that her caregiver (daughter) is unable to provide the care she needs in the form of access to food/nutrtion. Pt herself suggested contacting APS at PCP appt 7/23, though unable to confirm through EPIC if this has been done. Concern for malignancy (pt refused colo in past) given cachetic state despite seemingly appropriate appetite. PET/CT 2/2013 with increased pelvic uptake. Previously worked up by PCP for malabsorption though unremarkable. Started on vitamin supplementation for several deficiencies and recent lab work on hospitalization 8/8 with improving levels. Ultimately will benefit from SNF placement and potentially long-term care facility.  If care-giver neglect is major contributor, expect improvement at rehab facility though PT/OT gains now limited by current pelvic fracture.   - nutrition consult  - ensure tid  - continue vit c, B6, Vit A, thiamine, os-cal  - PT/OT  - CM consult re: SNF options  - SW consult to f/u on possible neglect, status of APS  - check pre-albumin, albumin  - daily weights, monitor I/Os  - reschedule colonoscopy if pt willing, mammogram     #Pelvic Fx, Chronic Back pain: Displaced right inferior pubic ramus fracture on CT 8/14 s/p mechanical fall 8/1. No new fractures on pelvic XR from current admission. No new neuro deficits or e/o cord compression. Nml MRI L spine 8/3/13. Previously evaluated by ortho (though current fx not initially seen on plain films) who recommended conservative management with pain control and early ambulation. Pain control has been significant issue in past given chronic nature of back pain and pain contract was signed with PCP at SIM clinic 4/2013 stating she is not to receive additional narcotics from the ED or SIM clinic. Pt was referred to pain clinic 8/19 though is now hospitalized.  At last PCP appt 8/14, pt was continued on oxycodone 20mg po q3hrs  prn and gabapentin dose was increased. Will benefit from pain consult and ongoing PT/OT, likely SNF if pt agreeable.  - ortho consult in AM (deferred by ED) re: management of fx   - WBAT, early ambulation, fall precautions  - oxycodone 20mg po q 3hr prn (outpt rx)  - gabapentin 600mg tid, 900mg qhs  - continue valium 2.5 mg q6 h prn muscle spasms  - consider pain consult (pt had outpt appt 8/19)  - PT/OT  - avoiding IV narcotics if possible given pain contract, though with known fx, may need low dose for breakthrough  - colace, dulcolax supp prn constipation    #Hx of Seizures: Currently on Keppra 250 mg bid. Evaluated by neuro during last hospitalization who recommended increasing dose to 500mg bid (usual dosing) but has not had recurrent seizures. Keppra level previously low at 8 on 8/6/13.    - f/u on keppra level  - continue keppra 250 mg bid, consider up-titrating to 500mg bid if level still low  - f/u with neuro as scheduled (ensure appt made, not seen in EPIC)    #Hx of SVT/HTN: BP and HR well controlled  - continue nadolol 40mg po daily    #COPD- continues to smoke. Emphysematous changes on CXR. PFTs ordered in 4/2013 but never completed.   - continue albuterol prn, advair bid (replaces symbicort as inpt)  - encouraged smoking cessation    # FEN/GI:  - Diet: regular diet, ensure supplements  - GI Prophylaxis: protonix po    # Prophylaxis:  - VTE Prophylaxis: SCDs, avoiding sc hep given recent fx, possible ortho intervention (will restart if deemed appropriate per ortho eval)    # Dispo: PT/OT eval, likely SNF    # Code Status: Full Code     # Extended Emergency Contact Information  Primary Emergency Contact: Stofer, Sarah  Address: 1364 Branham Ln Apt 1           San Jose, CA 95118-2545 United States of America  Home Phone: 408-561-3662  Mobile Phone: 408-824-3744  Relation: Daughter  Secondary Emergency Contact: Vose, David  Address: Patient Declined           San Jose, CA 95118-2545 United States of  America  Home Phone: 925-719-3229  Mobile Phone: 925-719-3229  Relation: Brother    Pt seen and discussed in detail with attending physician, Mohabir, Paul K, MD, who agrees with above assessment and plan, except as amended.

"40",40,135,FALSE,"","Stanford Hospital and Clinics  Neurology Initial Note    Date:2/5/2013  Attending: Gilbert, Gregory H, MD  Service: General  Primary Care Provider: Dave, Amish  Phone: 650-725-5071           ID: Marsha C Vose is a 57 Y female patient.    Chief Complaint: seizure    HPI:  57F with COPD, peripheral artery disease, chronic malnutrition, previous seizure presenting with 3 seizures today. Her daughter provides history as the patient is somnolent. The pt has chronic malnutrition and failure to thrive from unknown etiology, though her PCP suspects she has an undiagnosed malignancy. She was in the ATIC this afternoon for a vitamin infusion today (Vit B1, B6, C). When she got home she had a convulsive seizure. Her daughter describes that she was sitting on the couch and then her eyes rolled backwards and then she had stiffening of her body and then whole body shaking. She thinks her eyes may have been looking to the left. The seizure lasted 90 seconds and then stopped. She was drowsy and confused afterwards. Then about 30 minutes later, before she had fully returned to baseline, she had another seizure lasting 90 seconds and then a third when the ambulance arrived.     She on arrival to the ER she was hemodynamically stable, protecting her airway. She was given 1mg ativan iv. CT head was unremarkable and labs were all within normal limits or unchanged from her baseline except an increased Cr to 1.3 from a baseline of 0.6. She was loaded with keppra 750mg iv x1.     Her daughter reports her first seizure was in 2011 and it was convulsive. Since then she has a seizure every 3-4 months, sometimes 2 in one day. She has missed her appointments with neurology and has never been on an AED. In 10/2011 she had an MRI that was unremarkable, though she was unable to tolerate gadolinium. She also had a spot EEG that did not show any epileptiform discharges. She has been on gabapentin 600 QID and diazepam 5 TID for chronic pain.     At  baseline she is sharp, witty. She is able to walk around the house while holding on the objects, but does not walk outside the house. She uses a wheelchair when leaving the house.

"41",41,135,FALSE,"","Stanford University Hospital  History and Physical    Date: 5/2/2013         Service: Medicine     Attending: No att. providers found  Admit Date: 5/1/2013  Primary Care Provider:Dave, Amish     Phone:650-725-5071  Medical Record Number: 07388861    ID: Marsha C Vose is a 57 Y female HTN, HL, peripheral artery disease, seizure disorder on Keppra, chronic malnutrition with severe cachexia, COPD (?) an current smoker who was initially admitted to CDU but now admitted to Medicine for altered mental status/delirium.       HPI:   Her history is derived from prior notes as she is floridly delirious during my encounter with her.    Per Dr. Zhang's Neurology consult note from this admission:  """"57F with COPD, peripheral artery disease, chronic malnutrition, with possible underlying unknown malignancy, seizure disorder started on Keppra in 2/2013 with dosage increase on 4/29/13 now presenting with concern for seizure. On 5/1/13, the patient's daughter woke up in the afternoon and noted that her mother was very confused and trying to drink the ash in the tray. She assumed that her mother may have had a seizure because her mother always has confusion after a seizure. The patient daughter never witness any activity that resembles the patient's typical seizure activity (her eyes roll backwards, stiffening of her body and then whole body shaking that lasts a few seconds to minutes, with associated urinary incontinence and tongue biting and post ictal confusion). These seizures occur once every few months. The patient was first seen by neurology in 2/2013. She had an unremarkable EEG at that time, was started on keppra 250 BID (she was previously not on any anti seizure medication). The patient presented on 4/29 with seizure again, and neurology recommended increasing keppra to 500mg BID. According to the patient's daughter (live in care taker), the patient has been taking all of her medications consistently and has not exhibited  any constitutional symptoms that is concerning for infection.     In the ED, the patient was found to have potassium of 2.6, and EKG showed T wave inversions in 2 leads (V1-V2). The plan was to transfer the patient to the CDU for cardiac rule out. UA negative, CXR unremarkable, wbc count not elevated. Neurology was consulted for management of seizure medications. According to the ED physicians, the patient was A+Ox4 just before midnight. When Neurology saw the patient, she was alert, had fluent speech, followed all commands, could give some of her recent medical history but did not know the date or place; she was also witnessed to talk briefly to the wall but was easily redirectable. By 2:00am the patient was consistently hallucinating; she was smoking a cigarette that wasn't there, talking to people not in the room, trying to get out of bed to walk outside.""""     Psychiatry was consulted for agitation while pt in CDU, per Dr. Crawford's note """"she was combative, yelling expletives, attempted to hit RN, she would not answer any questions, appeared grossly disoriented.   Pt was given Zyprexa Zydis 5mg IM with calming effect. Two hours later became agitated again, yelling expletives and attempting to pull out IV/lines.  Spoke with daughter, who is currently being seen by ED physicians in another section of ED for an acute issue. Daughter reports pt was combative once before, in February after a seizure. She was also acting bizarre and saying things that did not make sense after her two seizures this weekend. She says pt has had no recent medication changes besides Keppra. She has not complained of fever or any infectious symptoms.""""     On my encounter with the patient, she endorses pain in the epigastric area, denied SOB, palpitations, is present all the time.  She then proceeded to sing songs, followed by asking me to pass her a lighter so she could smoke her imaginary cigarette (no lighter present, patient in 4 point  restraints at that time).  Per discussion with NP Christine Tacklind the patient had been calm on arrival to the CDU, but then became agitated, aggressive, hitting staff and swearing at them.

She is exhibiting signs of hyperactive delirium as she has fluctuating mental status.  Etiology for her delirium is multifactorial, including use of benzos and opioids, possible seizures with an increase in her keppra, chronic malnutirtion, underlying diseases, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia), and possibly thyroid hormone abnormalities (her last TSH was at lower limit of nl as was her FT4).  She does not appear to be infected given her studies.

Chief Complaint: FTT    HPI:   Ms. Vose is a 58 yo W with HTN, HL, PAD, SVT, seizure do on keppra, chronic malnutrition and cachexia, active cig smoking and possible COPD (no PFTs), chronic LBP, and recent fall with tail bone fx presenting with FTT.    She was last admitted from the CDU to medicine on 5/3/13 for AMS.  She was seen by psych and neuro and the plan was to wean her keppra (given depression) and to replace it with depakote.  Psych recommended using olanzapine and she was discharged to see her PCP Dr. Artandi and in epilepsy clinic.  Her neurologists suspect that her cachexia (63#) is due to a catabolic state possibly from an occult malig despite adequate nutrition.  She underwent PET/CT which showed multiple areas of increased pelvic uptake.  She has refused colo but was referred to Dr. Ann Chen for further GI eval.  Many of her clinic notes warn not to prescribe any additional narcotics and she has been on a strict pain contract.  The family has become verbally aggressive when additional narcotics was not prescribed.     She was last seen in clinic on 7/23 by her PCP Dr. Artandi who concluded that her malnutrition might be 2/2 her dtr being unable to care for the pt and not feeding the pt at home.  She considered calling APS.  Her dtr is her IHSS.    She presented to the ED on 8/1 after falling onto her right side with R hip pain.  Ortho was consulted and CT showed bl zone 1 sacral insuff fx without displacement.  Her falls are mechanical in nature and typically ambulates a short distance with the assistance of furniture but has tripped and fallen multiple times.  She was able to ambulate in the ED with assistance.  She has had bowel/badder  """"incont"""" for approx 1 mo although it appears as if this is due to inability to get to the bathroom in time.  She left AMA from the ED.  Ortho recommended pain control, WBAT, and CT spine.      She has not fallen since.  She returned to the ED on 8/2 with worsened LB pain.  An MRI was recommended but she again decided to leave AMA.  She was noted to ambulate with a stead gait to smoke inside and outside the ED prior to leaving.  She returned later that night when an MRI L spine was done showing no cord comp.  She is well known to the SW service of our hospital.  The pt's dtr became angry with the SW since it was deemed that ambulance transportation was not necessary to bring the pt home.      The pt called Dr. Artandi today c/o persistent (not worse) LBP and Dr. Artandi advised the pt to go to the ED for pain control, FTT, and placement.  The ED SW consulted given the concern for abuse and neglect.  Per the pt, she can still ambulate but needs assistance from her dtr.  Her dtr feels like she needs extra help at home.  She is willing to consider SNF/rehab.      In the ED, the pt received 1 mg dilaudid IV.  Her VSS.  Admission to medicine was requested.  Since she had no acute neuro deficits on history or exam and a recent reassuring MRI without additional trauma occuring, I deferred further imaging.      PMH:  #COPD?

He was initiated on Vancomycin, Meropenem and Levaquin for coverage of his known MRSA, Steno and Pseudomonas along with aggressive airway clearance. After 5 days of Meropenem, this was changed to Ceftaz per susceptibilities and inhaled Tobi was added for enhanced Pseudomonas coverage.  He began to feel pulmonary improvement with less cough and resolution of dyspnea on exertion.  He developed loose stools and Cdiff test on 5/17 was negative.  On 5/17, patient requested a change to Ceftaz as diarrhea seemed to have worsened when it was started, therefore Aztreonam was substituted for Ceftaz (similarly susceptibility profile)  Review of Systems:  A comprehensive review of systems was negative except for: those noted in HPI    Past Medical History:   Diagnosis Date   ¿ Alcohol abuse, unspecified    ¿ CF (cystic fibrosis) (CMS-HCC)    ¿ Chronic constipation 11/29/2017   ¿ Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (CMS-HCC)    ¿ Pancreatic insufficiency    ¿ Renal insufficiency    ¿ Seizure disorder (CMS-HCC)        Past Surgical History:   Procedure Laterality Date   ¿ COMPLETE BILATERAL ENDOSCOPIC TOTAL ETHMOIDECTOMY, MAXILLARY ANTROSTOMY WITH TISSUE REMOVAL, FRONTAL SINUSOTOMY, SPHENOIDOTOMY WITH TISSUE REMOVAL, EXCISION OF INFERIOR TURBINATE AND SEPTOPLASTY.

CEFAZOLIN is the preferred antibiotic for MSSA infections that do not involve the central nervous system (CNS). Cefazolin is better   tolerated, less costly, and yields similar clinical outcomes as nafcillin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. For CNS infections, nafcillin is the preferred antibiotic, ID consult is recommended.

Was on maintenance pemetrexed/pembrolizumab, though pemetrexed was discontinued due to renal dysfunction. Now on maintenance pembrolizumab, currently on hold due to fatigue. She presents to clinic today for follow up with new imaging.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness (adapted from prior notes):   This is a 73 Y female with a diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer whose oncologic history is summarized as follows:     October 2019 - Started feeling like she had very little energy, dizziness, L leg weakness, difficulty walking, headaches.     10/23/2019 - PCP ordered a low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening. This showed a new spiculated 1.5 cm left lower lobe nodule is concerning for malignancy.    11/09/2019 PET-CT:  IMPRESSION: Â   1. 1.3 cm nodule left lower lobe with markedly increased uptake,  concerning for malignancy. Â Abnormal lymph nodes at the posterior  aspect of the  subcarinal space and at the left lateral aspect of  the larger node, concerning for metastatic lymphadenopathy.    11/13/2019 Brain MRI/MRA:  IMPRESSION:   1. There is contiguous mildly expansile T2/FLAIR signal  abnormality extending from the level of the right  thalamus/temporal lobe to the right medulla. Â Fairly central to  this broad zone of signal abnormality is a subtle masslike area  measuring 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.5 cm at the right upper pons. Â In light  of known lung malignancy, the findings may represent a metastasis  with marked surrounding edema. Â Given the broad extent of  involvement, differential may include a large infiltrative  primary brain neoplasm or less likely an infectious process.   Recommend additional contrast-enhanced imaging for further  evaluation.  2. Â Scattered punctate T2/FLAIR hyperintense white matter foci  elsewhere most likely reflect sequela of chronic small vessel  ischemic disease.    11/19/2019 - Bronchoscopy. FNA of two subcarinal lymph nodes: both positive for metastatic carcinoma. Cells appear poorly differentiated; positive for CK7 (adenocarcinoma) and GATA3 (can be c/w urothelial, breast); negative for lung markers TTF-1, Napsin-A. Negative for neuroendocrine markers.  ADDENDUM: PD-L1 80%.     11/26/2019 - Brain MRI: IMPRESSION: There is heterogeneous enhancement of the right  paramedian pontine lesion. Differential possibilities remain the same, and include   primary and metastatic disease. No additional enhancing lesions of the brain are identified.    12/4/19 - Initial visit with Stanford Thoracic Oncology.    12/05/19 Completed CK to brainstem lesion.     12/16/19:  EGFR mutational panel - negative.     12/18/19:  C1 carbo/pem/pembro    1/02/20:  CT Chest - response to treatment.

Signed""""Final report""""     Pathology:   11/19/2019 FNA lymph nodes  Specimen:  A:Left Hilum  B:FNA subcarina  lymph node #1  C:FNA subcarina lymph node #2    FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:  Lymph node, left hilum, fine needle aspiration: Predominately blood elements and rare atypical cells   Lymph node, subcarina #1: Positive for metastatic carcinoma  Lymph node, subcarina #2: Positive for metastatic carcinoma    Tumor cells are positive for CK7 and GATA-3 while negative for Mammaglobin on GATA-3/mammaglobin stain. Tumor cells are negative for TTF-1 and napsin-A on TTF-1/napsin-A combination stain, negative for CDX-2 and CK20 on CDX-2/CK20 combination stain, p40 and CK5 on p40 /CK5 combination stain. Tumor cells are negative for synaptophysin, ER, uroplakin, Her2/neu, and SOX-10. PAX-8 shows non-specific focal positive staining of unclear significance. Overall, the findings are supportive of metastatic carcinoma. Although site specific markers are lacking, the primary site of origin may include, lung, breast and urinary tract origin. Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended.

Impression / Plan:    In summary, Ms. Carol Lose is a 73 Y female with Stage IV likely NSCLC (although pathology is not definitive for lung adenocarcinoma, the CK7 positivity and pattern of spiculated lung nodule with local lymph node and brain metastasis s/p CK, especially in a smoker, is most consistent with primary lung cancer). She completed 4 cycles of first line carbo/pem/pembro. Then was on maintenance pembrolizumab/pemetrexed, however, pemetrexed was discontinued due to rising creatinine. Currently on a treatment break and presents for follow up.     Ms. Lose is overall feeling well with minimal symptoms having been on pembrolizumab treatment break since May 2021.  She notes increased dry  skin and we advised to trial applying Eucerin cream to her skin daily, though she has an appointment with supportive dermatology on 1/19/22. We have reviewed and discussed 1/4/22 CT chest imaging in detail which revealed stable disease without new or growing suspicious pulmonary nodules.  Therefore, we plan to repeat CT chest in 3 months. Her last MR brain 6/2021 was stable and she is due repeat due in March 2022 per CK team.  However, given her HA's and change in vision over the last few months we would like the MR brain to be moved up to a sooner time for evaluation and will reach out to the CK team for assistance with scheduling.      We also note she has not had labs completed since 8/2021, have asked her to get her labs drawn sometime in the next week, and notify our clinic once they have been completed.  We otherwise will plan to see her back in clinic in 3 months to review her CT Chest imagign and labs, but sooner if needed pending MR brain results. The patient was amendable to this plan and knows to reach out to our clinic if new or worsening symptoms.     Plan:  #Stage IV poorly differentiated non-small cell adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the lymph nodes and brainstem s/p CK, EGFR/ALK/ROS1 negative, high PD-L1 (TPS 80%)   - Current therapy: HOLDING pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks due to ongoing fatigue (last dose 5/19/21). Maintenance pemetrexed d/c due to rising creatinine  - stable interval CT chest. Repeat in 3 months, ordered today.   - Seen by Rad Onc. Not eligible for RRADICAL given no measurable disease per RECIST criteria.  _ Repeat Labs  - MR brain next available   - RTC in 3 months with Dr. Neal to review CT scan (ordered today)    #Metastasis to brainstem  - S/p CK on 12/4/19.   - 6/25/21 brain MRI - stable. Next brain MRI due March 2022 per CK team (9 month)  - Patient with mild intermittent R sided HA's and change in vision x2-3 months.  Will reach out to CK team to assist in scheduling  MR brain in the next week or two.    #Fatigue, likely multifactorial: improved  - Her fatigue has improved. Likely multifactorial including psychosocial issues vs immunotherapy related.  - Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg daily on empty stomach.   - TSH WNL 8/2021.  Needs repeat labs.    #h/o Elevated Creatinine, improved  - Baseline Cr is 0.8-1.   - Likely in the setting of pemetrexed.

Still has stable housing. Has the support of one son.  - Followed by SW previously    #h/o Frustration/anxiety  - f/u with  Nicole Barr.  - continue Wellbutrin per psych    #h/o Insomnia  -patient with prior use of trazodone and alprazolam with no significant benefit.  -continue to use trazodone.   -advised sleep hygiene.  -continue recs per psycho onc.  -advised mindful activities such as meditation through Calm or headspace app.     #Active smoking   -cessation strategies discussed previously, encouraged her to try nicotine lozenges or gum via her PCP since she states that patches are not that effective at preventing urges.  -Continues to smoke 2-3 cigarettes per day  RTC 3 months with repeat labs and CT chest pending MR brain results.    As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    I personally spent a total of 20 minutes which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time  spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.

I conducted the visit in conjunction with the spectacular nursing, social work, and nutrition staff at WellBound San Mateo. Thank you for asking that I see Mr. Barrientos Garcia in ongoing consultation for end-stage kidney disease associated with  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with multiple complications including disseminated mycobacterium tuberculosis; refractory hypothyroidism, finally improved; a recent hospitalization with substernal and epigastric pain and complicated by incidentally discovered COVID-19; history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease; hypertension, now absent; hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia, now both improved; hyperphosphatemia; and secondary hyperparathyroidism. He was unaccompanied.    Mr. Barrientos Garcia has had several hospitalizations including a 15-day hospitalization at Stanford in mid January 2022, which followed on the heels of a hospitalization at San Mateo County Medical Center with peritonitis approximately one week earlier.     At today's visit, Mr. Barrientos Garcia was complaining of bright-red blood per rectum. He also had complaints of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. He denies fever, chills or other constitutional symptoms. He has been undergoing directly observed therapy for disseminated mycobacterium tuberculosis. He has been very carefully followed by Drs. Contag and Nelson along with staff from the Department of Public Health in San Mateo County. Mr. Barrientos Garcia has been performing his peritoneal dialysis therapy on a regular basis without complication. His peritoneal dialysate has been crystal clear since completing a course of vancomycin for presumed gram-positive peritonitis. I was unable to access records from San Mateo County Medical Center, though I did receive a verbal report that peritoneal dialysate cultures showed no growth.     On physical examination, the blood pressure was elevated, in contrast to reports of much lower blood pressures during Mr. Barrientos Garcia's recent hospitalization and other recent medical records. The body weight was 63.7 kg (subtracting the 2 L of icodextrin solution within the peritoneal cavity). The blood pressure while sitting was 164/78 and while standing  145/85 mmHg. Corresponding pulse rates were 67 and 70 beats per minute respectively. The oral temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The head and neck were normal. The eyes, ears, nose and throat were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower extremities were of normal muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.     The peritoneal dialysis prescription consists of 10,800 mL delivered over 10-1/3 hours, fill volumes of 2400 mL, and 4 cycles. By peritoneal equilibrium testing, Mr. Barrientos Garcia is a low-average transporter.     On physical examination, the head and neck were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. The peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site was clean and dry.  Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower extremities were of slightly diminished muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.    Laboratory data were available from the Satellite Partners Information Network, having been collected on February 14. The BUN and creatinine were 33 and 10.54 mg/dL respectively. The serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate concentrations were 128, 4.3, 91, and 27 mmol/L respectively. The serum calcium, phosphate, and albumin concentrations were 8.8 mg/dL, 2.0 mg/dL, and 3.1 g/dL respectively, likely reflecting poor dietary protein intake. The hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL with an hematocrit of 32.3%. The leukocyte and platelet counts were 8205 and 157,000 per mcL, respectively, the latter likely reflecting chronic and ongoing inflammation and possibly iron deficiency. Urea kinetics demonstrated a total Kt/V urea of 1.99, comfortably above international clinical practice guideline targets. The residual kidney function (from 373 mL of urine), showed a creatinine clearance of 1.7 mL/minute per 1.73 sq m. The weekly residual Kt/V was 0.21 demonstrating that the bulk of solute clearance is coming from Mr. Barrientos Garcia's dialysis. The normalized protein nitrogen appearance was 0.7, suggesting adequate, but not excessive, dietary protein intake.     In summary, Mr. Ricardo Barrientos Garcia is a delightful 57-year-old Guatemalteco with end-stage kidney disease  associated with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with innumerable complications, particularly over the past 18 months. Most notably, severe refractory hypothyroidism, lymphadenopathy, and recent discovery by lymph node biopsy of systemic disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mr. Barrientos Garcia's condition is further compromised by multiple social determinants of health. When he arrived in the United States, he was working regularly. He has not been working over the past 1 to 1-1/2 years owing to a reduction in day labor hiring in the construction industry. He is a gentleman of a very modest means and has spent through virtually all his savings. He has been anxious to return to either Guatemala or El Salvador where he might obtain a kidney transplant at a lower price than what might be required should he stay in the United States. He has been separated from family for several years. He has been stably housed but has significant food insecurity.     I commend our facility social worker, Ms. Mari Regev, for creatively identifying resources to assist Mr. Barrientos Garcia.     With respect to more immediate issues, I spoke briefly with Dr. Contag during the latter half of Mr. Barrientos Garcia's visit. She has been working tireously to ensure that Mr. Barrientos Garcia receives his tuberculous therapy. I worry that Mr. Barrientos Garcia is attributing a variety of signs and symptoms due to his underlying health conditions to the RIPE therapy. I reminded him of the importance of maintaining adherence with his antituberculous therapy. Mr. Barrientos Garcia has visits arranged with Dr. Goldenberg next week and his new primary care physician, Dr. Mugdha Joshi, the Monday following.     Dr. Contag and I have were both very concerned about Mr. Barrientos Garcia's abdominal pain which could represent tuberculous ileitis or colitis or possibly a garden variety diverticulitis or typhlitis.     I requested  imaging in the next few days with CT abdomen pelvis with radiocontrast.     I also urged Mr. Barrientos Garcia to seek immediate care, either at Hoover Express Care or at Stanford Emergency Department, should he developed new fevers or worsening abdominal pain.     Thank you again for entrusting me with Mr. Barrientos Garcia's kidney disease and dialysis care.

I was unable to access records from San Mateo County Medical Center, though I did receive a verbal report that peritoneal dialysate cultures showed no growth.     On physical examination, the blood pressure was elevated, in contrast to reports of much lower blood pressures during Mr. Barrientos Garcia's recent hospitalization and other recent medical records. The body weight was 63.7 kg (subtracting the 2 L of icodextrin solution within the peritoneal cavity). The blood pressure while sitting was 164/78 and while standing 145/85 mmHg. Corresponding pulse rates were 67 and 70 beats per minute respectively. The oral temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The head and neck were normal. The eyes, ears, nose and throat were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower  extremities were of normal muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.     The peritoneal dialysis prescription consists of 10,800 mL delivered over 10-1/3 hours, fill volumes of 2400 mL, and 4 cycles. By peritoneal equilibrium testing, Mr. Barrientos Garcia is a low-average transporter.     On physical examination, the head and neck were normal. Fundoscopy was deferred. There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. There was no jugular venous distension. There were no carotid bruits. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination showed a normal S1 and S2; there was no S3 gallop, no murmurs, and no pericardial rub. The abdomen was soft, non-distended and non-tender, with no palpable masses. The peritoneal dialysis catheter exit site was clean and dry. Rectal and genital examinations were deferred. There were no audible abdominal, renal, or femoral bruits. The lower extremities were of slightly diminished muscle bulk. There was no periorbital, presacral, or peripheral edema. Peripheral pulses were palpable and of normal intensity. There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease. There were no abnormalities of the hair, skin, or nails. Neurologic examination was grossly non-focal. Gait was normal. There was no asterixis or myoclonus. Affect, cognition, and attention were normal. There was no uremic fetor or other abnormalities reflecting advanced chronic kidney disease.    Laboratory data were available from  the Satellite Partners Information Network, having been collected on February 14. The BUN and creatinine were 33 and 10.54 mg/dL respectively. The serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate concentrations were 128, 4.3, 91, and 27 mmol/L respectively. The serum calcium, phosphate, and albumin concentrations were 8.8 mg/dL, 2.0 mg/dL, and 3.1 g/dL respectively, likely reflecting poor dietary protein intake. The hemoglobin was 10.5 g/dL with an hematocrit of 32.3%. The leukocyte and platelet counts were 8205 and 157,000 per mcL, respectively, the latter likely reflecting chronic and ongoing inflammation and possibly iron deficiency. Urea kinetics demonstrated a total Kt/V urea of 1.99, comfortably above international clinical practice guideline targets. The residual kidney function (from 373 mL of urine), showed a creatinine clearance of 1.7 mL/minute per 1.73 sq m. The weekly residual Kt/V was 0.21 demonstrating that the bulk of solute clearance is coming from Mr. Barrientos Garcia's dialysis. The normalized protein nitrogen appearance was 0.7, suggesting adequate, but not excessive, dietary protein intake.     In summary, Mr. Ricardo Barrientos Garcia is a delightful 57-year-old Guatemalteco with end-stage kidney disease associated with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with innumerable complications, particularly over the past 18 months. Most notably, severe refractory hypothyroidism, lymphadenopathy, and recent discovery by lymph node biopsy of systemic disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mr. Barrientos Garcia's condition is further compromised by multiple social determinants of health. When he arrived in the United States, he was working regularly. He has not been working over the past 1 to 1-1/2 years owing to a reduction in day labor hiring in the construction industry. He is a gentleman of a very modest means and has spent through virtually all his savings. He has been anxious to  return to either Guatemala or El Salvador where he might obtain a kidney transplant at a lower price than what might be required should he stay in the United States. He has been separated from family for several years. He has been stably housed but has significant food insecurity.     I commend our facility social worker, Ms. Mari Regev, for creatively identifying resources to assist Mr. Barrientos Garcia.     With respect to more immediate issues, I spoke briefly with Dr. Contag during the latter half of Mr. Barrientos Garcia's visit. She has been working tireously to ensure that Mr. Barrientos Garcia receives his tuberculous therapy. I worry that Mr. Barrientos Garcia is attributing a variety of signs and symptoms due to his underlying health conditions to the RIPE therapy. I reminded him of the importance of maintaining adherence with his antituberculous therapy. Mr. Barrientos Garcia has visits arranged with Dr. Goldenberg next week and his new primary care physician, Dr. Mugdha Joshi, the Monday following.     Dr. Contag and I have were both very concerned about Mr. Barrientos Garcia's abdominal pain which could represent tuberculous ileitis or colitis or possibly a garden variety diverticulitis or typhlitis.     I requested imaging in the next few days with CT abdomen pelvis with radiocontrast.     I also urged Mr. Barrientos Garcia to seek immediate care, either at Hoover Express Care or at Stanford Emergency Department, should he developed new fevers or worsening abdominal pain.     Thank you again for entrusting me with Mr. Barrientos Garcia's kidney disease and dialysis care.

HDS and afebrile on evaluation. PE notable for right paraspinal ttp, regular tachycardia with holosystolic murmur, and BLE neuropathy.     Regarding her lower back pain which is her chief complaint at this time:   Ddx broad but includes paraspinal muscle strain (most likely given right paraspinal ttp, some discomfort with hip ROM, onset 2 weeks ago while cleaning her apt, pain worse with  sitting upright), trauma/vertebral compression fracture (advanced age, atraumatic, thinks she might have osteoporosis but no midline ttp or step offs), SEA (unlikely given no f/c, no midline ttp, no new neurovascular deficits), cord compression/cauda equina (no new incontinence, saddle anesthesia, BLE weakness).    Regarding her GLF last night:  Ddx: favoring mechanical at this time given her excellent recall of the event that was corroborated by both son and facility RN. However, her fall was unwitnessed. She denies antecedent sx but etiologies to consider include cardiac (no reported cardiac hx, apparently new holosystolic murmur on exam with regular tachycardia, clinically euvolemic to slightly volume down, EKG without ischemic changes, trop wnl), neurologic (benign neuro exam), orthostatic (poor appetite per patient, 32lbs weight loss in 3 months, temporal wasting, underfilled LV on POCUS), infectious (no reports of cough, SOB, dysuria, flank pain)    Other issues include her failure of independent ADLs.

He thinks she is not functioning well enough to live independently - not eating very much (32lbs weight loss in the past 3 months), very poor mobility around the house, struggles to dress herself, cannot get into her shower (no shower in about 9 months per son, she washes herself with wipes instead), limited social engagement, cluttered apt.    Son went to visit her a few days ago, found out she hadn't had a BM in several days. Took her to urgent care who gave her laxative and gabapentin after r/o obstruction.

CXR showed bibasilar linear opacifications most favored to represent atelectasis. CT head/cspine without e/o ICH or cspine fracture. CT pelvis showed no fracture within the pelvis or visualized proximal femurs. CT lumbar spine showed no acute lumbar spine fracture or malalignment, likely chronic superior endplate compression deformities at L2 and L4, and degenerative changes most pronounced at L3-L4 and L4-L5 where there is moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis. She failed 2-person assist ambulation trial.    Overall her presentation is most consistent with subacute paraspinal muscle strain and chronic vertebral degenerative changes. She appears to have no acute injuries from her GLF last night. However, given her independent living situation and failure to ambulate even with 2 person assist, she is best served with admission to the CDU with PT consult. Discussed with patient and son who both are amenable to this. Appreciate excellent CDU care.

According to their note, """"On presentation today, the patient exhibits features of psychotic illness including possible internal preoccupation and negative symptoms (paucity of speech, minimal social engagement). However, the patient has functioned sufficiently to provide for himself in the setting of limited resources prior to hospitalization, including providing shelter and obtaining food from others. There is no evidence that he would be unable to continue to provide for his needs by these strategies as a result of  his psychiatric condition. The patient is uninterested in antipsychotic medications at this time, and per his report, he would unlikely follow up with an outpatient psychiatrist. We therefore do not have concerns from a psychiatric standpoint at this time with the possibility of discharge to shelter.""""

At intake visit 4/8/2021, she was obviously short of breath but did not have any clear pulmonary etiology by PFTs or CT-PE.  Echo and ECG needed to confirm no cardiac etiology--> echo essentially normal done 8/5/2021.  Could be obesity hypoventilation given noncompliance with CPAP and OSA.  Also has a history of factitious disorder.

However, 4/24/21 and 5/18/2021 she was brought into emergency department by ambulance with concern for self-harm.   4/24/2021 she had ingested 60 hydroxyzine stating she was trying to harm her self after getting into an argument with her sister.  5/18/2021 she got upset after an argument in a group program and made multiple statements about feeling suicidal.  In both instances she was released after calming down and being treated denying any continued interest in self-harm.  Part of this reaction has been attributed to her autism spectrum disorder and not knowing how to cope with difficulty.  Regardless, Contrave is not a good option for her.  Â   GLP-1 agonist: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Currently limited by SI as mentioned above.  She also needs labs, current weight, and discussion about whether or not she is willing and able to take injection medication.

First time she felt larger than usual was mid teens needing  large/XL pants, then lost to 130#, then started gaining, did get to 200+ got down to 180#, then has been gaining since.  -Previous weight loss efforts:Â diet and exercise, gains have been during """"relapses"""", typical diet has been Southern cooking, FHx paternal side obesity  -Most helpful in previous weight loss efforts:Â diet and exercise  - Medical/psychological/other causes of/contributors to obesity at intake include:Â inadequate physical activity, excess caloric intake,Â depression, PTSD,Â night eating, occasional MJ use, OSA, asthma, insomnia, poor sleep hygiene, LBP with walking  - Obesogenic medications at intake include:Â Gabapentin, prazosin, unclear if any contribution from OCP;Â conversely, metformin is associated with weight loss  - Obesity comorbidities at intake include:Â Some worsening ofÂ depressionÂ (+SI passive/h/o attempt 2+ years ago),Â DM2,Â OSA,Â likely contributor toÂ asthma, GERD, LBP with walking, urinary incontinence    #Pulm:  #OSA:  #Asthma:  On video visit at intake 4/8/2021, she was noticeably SOB with talking or shifting position from lying to sitting.Â NotÂ able to cook at home muchÂ 2/2 SOB. She said sheÂ¿d seen a pulmonologist at SMMC, butÂ I didnÂ¿t seen anything in the SMMC records about this.Â Â Asked PCP to refer her to pulmonary if not done already--> no pulmonology visit as of 7/15/2021. Â Ms. Harris did say she had asthma and OSA but what I saw was not typical of this. PFTsÂ do not seem to correlate with symptomsÂ (Normal spirometry study, normal lung volume, and mildly reduced diffusion capacities. Â FEV1 is 2.88 L, 80% of predicted.). I wonder if sheÂ¿s developing OHS. SheÂ¿s not been adherent to CPAP.Â Â Negative D-dimer so unlikely to be PE. She warrants cardiac workup if no obviously pulmonary cause of her SOBÂ can be determined. Â Thus far, echo essentially nl. EKG not completed (ordered previously at SHC and have also asked SMMC PCP to do.) Asthma has been flaring up while she is moving around her new  place more to unpacking things away.  She reports purchasing a""""portable oxygen enhancement system"""" herself because """"doctors did not think I needed it"""".  She shows me the device, but it does not have any of the typical settings of either portable supplemental oxygen or an oxygen concentrator.  There is just an indicator for time which he was set at 60 minutes.  There are no markings for liters of oxygen. Using albuterol daily at minimum 2-4 puffs, BID QVAR.  - pulmonology visit at SMMC recommended  -need ekg  -Again, encouraged adherence to CPAP    #Behavioral Health/Medicine: History of ASD/Aspergers, anxiety, depression, PTSD. Self-reports a question of factitious disorder per her prior conversationsÂ with her mental health care providers. Â She was able to get through some college as her highest level of education. Â She did need some assistance with learning throughout her school years.  Reports night eating and """"food addiction"""".  Substance use notable for occasional MJ and 1-2 alcoholic drinks per week.  At intake 4/8/2021 she had both a psychiatrist and therapist that she sees through San Mateo Medical Center.   Has recurrent SI/SA. Feels thoughts are more frequent lately (at 4/8/21 intake); dad recently passed away near beginning of pandemic which is a major stressor/source of bereavement for her.  - Last SA 4/24/2021, ingestion of 60 hydroxyzine.  SI last in May 2021 when she was brought in by ambulance after threatening self-harm during an argument.  Prior to that, at 4/8/2021 intake, she reportedÂ mostly passing thoughtsÂ currently, having previously gone 2-3 years since prior SA.  -Safety plan as of 4/8/2021 includedreaching out to mom for help, crisis line, mom controls meds when this happens.

[4] This is a borderline result for hemoglobin A1c. If the patient is a known diabetic, it indicates excellent recent glycemic control. If the test was ordered for screening purposes, it indicates impaired glycemic control with a high risk of developing diabetes in the near future.

Reading Physician:   Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Michael McConnell, MD Â on 08/05/2021 03:48 PM   Performed By: Sofia Lim  ============================================================  Assess/Plan 1/20/2022:  Chanel E Harris is a 28 Y year-old female with Class III Obesity,Â depressionÂ (+SI passive/h/o attempt 2+ years ago), anxiety, PTSD, ?factitious disorderÂ (mentioned by patient),Â Asperger's with learning difficulties, night eating, occasional MJ use,Â DM2,Â OSA, asthma,  insomnia, poor sleep hygiene, GERD, LBP with walking, urinary incontinence, diarrhea of unclear etiology after eating, BC: OCPÂ   was seen today via video visit (in lieu of in-person visit due to   the COVID-19 pandemic) for weight management in the Bariatric Surgery & Medical Weight Loss Clinic.     #Obesity, Class III  #DM2  - Most recent weight is 319 lb, BMI 46 kg/m2  - This is  Up 8 lb since last documented weight 1 month ago. Weights have been challenging to track due to no having them provided at all visits.   - Given suicide attempts last year x2, she was instructed to review a list of weight loss medications with her psychiatrist prior to prescribing any since all reasonably effective FDA approved options have a risk of mood changes.   - Metformin, which she's been on at the 1000mg/day dose was increased to 2000mg today to aid in further weight mgmt (last hbA1c is 6.4% 8/21)  - Best weight mgmt option from a medical would be a GLP-1 agonist, in particular semaglutide, since she has diabetes and obesity.  However, this is contraindicated in the setting of suicidal ideation or attempts.  I would defer for her psychiatrist to weigh in on this.  Her echocardiogram is also normal as have her PFTs.  She would still need an EKG and accurate/current blood pressure on file to consider Qsymia as well as psychiatry approval.  Given agitation and anger previously in the setting of suicide attempts, Contrave seems like a less good option for her, but again I defer to her psychiatrist.  Orlistat is not a good option for her given vitamin D deficiency and inability to follow recommended diet due to cultural food traditions, learning disability, and food insecurity.  - Psychiatrist is Dr. Chrisasamo (sp?), prescribes prozac feels OK on this, no SI/SA since last attempt in 2021, follows up every couple months per her report, has a peer counselor every couple weeks, sees a family therapist weekly with her mother, no  psychologist individally however  -Diet:Now eating 1-2 meals per day (previously 3/day), trying to eat healthier, still lives with mom  Previously reported a Southern diet made it difficult to eat healthy, when asked for specific changes did not list any. Doesn't feel dieting is helping.Has seen RD in interim 12/23/21 VLCD group with Shirley Siu.  She does not think this is a good plan for her.  Also had an individual appointment for medical nutrition therapy.  At this visit, we recommended consistent mealtimes, 1 protein supplement meal replacement  -Sleep: Recommendations as below.  Notably, she is not adherent to CPAP because she stays up watching videos on her devices which require her to wear her glasses.  She then falls asleep watching the videos and forgot to put on the CPAP.  She typically uses her CPAP a couple times a week.  CPAP adherence recommended.  - Physical activity:-Mobility is significantly limited by shortness of breath deconditioning and low back pain. Â She is able to move around the house without a mobility device, but does have to use a 4 wheeled walker with seat to walk around outside the home and uses a wheelchair for any errands. Low back pain mainly bothers her after doing some walking. Â She does not endorse radiculopathy.  -She is also interested in bariatric surgery and has an upcoming appointment with Dr. Azagury.  Â   #Care coordination  - PCP:Â Hing-Hernandez, Amanda L, NP (SMMC)  - Lab preferenceÂ San Mateo Medical Center, Daly city.  - Most care received atÂ San Mateo Medical Center, Daly city.  -Psychiatrist:  Dr. Chrisasamo (sp?), follows up every couple months per her report, has a peer counselor every couple weeks, sees a family therapist weekly with her mother, no psychologist individally.    General recommendations:    #Diet  - For improvement in weight loss/management, general health, and most metabolic diseases, the diet should focus on the following foods: vegetables, whole  fruits, whole grains (ideally still in grain form, i.e., minimally-processed), legumes, and plant-based and lean proteins. Foods to minimize or eliminate include added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages, highly processed carbohydrate-rich foods, ultraprocessed foods, junk foods, red and processed meat. Calcium can be obtained from plant foods above or 2-3 servings of dairy or plant-based dairy alternatives.   - Dietary counseling addressed with RD, in Medgroups 2-4, or as applicable in 1:1 appts; they were encouraged to participate in the RD medically supervised weight loss program and/or the Medgroup program if applicable.    #Sleep:  - 7-8 hours of continuous sleep is recommended on a regular schedule for optimal health as well as weight loss/maintenance.   - If you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, it is important to follow recommendations to treat sleep apnea since untreated sleep apnea causes increased appetite, weight gain, and other medical problems like heart disease and diabetes.  - Medgroup1 discussion addresses optimal sleep, common disruptions, importance of treating medical and psychiatric conditions that may interfere with sleep, importance of good sleep hygeine, avoidance of blue light devices and ETOH within 2 and 3 hrs of sleep, respectively. They were encouraged to participate in the Medgroup program if applicable.  - Otherwise, as above     #Physical activity:  Â¿ Recommended levels of physical activity for heart disease prevention and weight maintenance are 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity (like brisk walking or swimming), or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity (like jogging), aerobic activity.   Â¿ Recommended physical activity for weight loss is 300 minutes per week of moderate intensity, or 150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity, aerobic activity.   Â¿ Everyone should do strength training of all major muscle groups two times weekly. One time would  include 8-12 repetitions and 2 sets. Body weight and resistance band exercises are included in this category. It is OK if you don't have weights or access to a gym.  Â¿ Aerobic activity can be broken up into many episodes, such as several 10-minute episodes of activity throughout the day.   Â¿ It's OK to start below these levels and work up. Activity will get easier as you get more fit.   Â¿ If you have chest pain, severe shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting, please stop exercise, and contact your medical professional before continuing to exercise. Consider going to the emergency department for evaluation especially if symptoms don't stop when you stop exercising.   Â¿ If you have difficulty with walking or balance, joint or other chronic pains, ask your medical provider about referral to physical therapy or other services that can help with these issues.   - This is addressed in detail in the Medgroup program and they were encouraged to participate if applicable.     #Mental and Behavioral Health:   -Many people with overweight and obesity also have symptoms of anxiety, depression, history of traumatic experiences, other mental health concerns, or eating for reasons other than hunger (like eating when stressed or in need of comfort) or have had eating disorders. Others take medications for mental health conditions that can cause weight gain. Alcohol intake and marijuana use can also cause weight gain; if you have difficulty controlling use of these substances, mental health providers can help. Most people aiming to lose weight would benefit from an assessment from a behavioral medicine specialist to address psychological and behavioral factors related to factors important for weight management such as dietary consumption, physical activity, pain, sleep, stress, substance use, and relationships/support.   -It is important for weight loss to make sure you have mental health care with a therapist, psychologist, and/or  psychiatrist, if needed. If any mental health conditions are present or suspected, evaluation by a psychiatrist and/or therapist is recommended. If ongoing care if recommended during the assessment, management of mental health conditions can aid in achieving weight management goals. If you have questions, please ask your medical provider at your next appointment.   - Brief introduction to behavioral medicine and brief intervention is conducted in Medgroup2; they were encouraged to participate if applicable.  - Otherwise, as above      See prior Stanford Bariatric Surgery and Medical Weight Loss Clinic notes for additional details of weight management plan and history.    Pt was encouraged to email me via MyHealth or call the clinic at any time with any concerns or questions regar"

Diabetic polyneuropathy associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (CMS-HCC)    3. Long term current use of insulin (CMS-HCC)    4. Hyperlipidemia, mixed    5. Class 3 severe obesity with serious comorbidity and body mass index (BMI) of 40.0 to 44.9 in adult, unspecified obesity type (CMS-HCC)    6. Fatty liver    7. Essential hypertension with goal blood pressure less than 140/90      A1c is above goal range, with no significant hypoglycemia.  Â¿ Lifestyle  interventions: reduce carbohydrate intake, increase exercise/activity, specifically work to eliminate sugary beverages, and add regular walking while watching TV  Â¿ Blood sugar monitoring: increase to checking 4 times daily, before meals and at bedtime.  Â¿ Medication regimen: start metformin XR with a gentle upwards increase to avoid loose bowel movements. Discussed large body of evidence that metformin has multiple beneficial effects to protect organ function, including brain, heart, liver, and kidney.  Â¿ Reviewed insulin injection technique, particularly rotating injection sites and avoiding area of lipohypertrophy. Adjusted prandial insulin dosing but did not increase given patient's goal of reducing insulin dependence with the high impact changes above.  Â¿ Reminded to update eye exam.    Blood pressure and cholesterol are above goal range but were not addressed today. We'll return to these long term heart/brain protective interventions over time, knowing that we will need a combination of lifestyle modifications and medication for her best health.

Â¿ Eat several small, nutrient-rich meals to avoid becoming breathless while eating.    Â¿ Eat slowly and chew foods thoroughly to avoid swallowing air while eating.    Â¿ Choose foods that are easy to chew. Modify food consistency if mastication seems to increase fatigue while eating.    Â¿ Choose foods that are easy to prepare to conserve energy for eating.    Â¿ Limit salt. Consuming too much can cause the body to retain water and can make breathing more difficult.    Â¿ Eat calcium- and vitamin D-rich foods to support bone health.    Â¿ Prepare meals that appear palatable and well presented.    Â¿ Avoid foods that cause gas or bloating. A full abdomen can make breathing uncomfortable.    Â¿ Eat while sitting up to ease lung pressure.    Â¿ Drink liquids at the end of the meal to avoid feeling full while eating.    Â¿ Wear a cannula while eating if continuous oxygen is prescribed. Eating and digestion require oxygen, so the body will need the extra oxygen.    Â¿ Limit caffeinated  beverages, as caffeine can interfere with some medications and cause nervousness or restlessness.    Â¿ Make the meal more enjoyable by engaging in social interaction while dining.    Â¿ Avoid aspiration by breathing carefully, swallowing, and sitting properly and with good posture while eating.    Â¿ Rest before meals.

Treatment team unsure if there's a socioeconomic factor in why he's not eating. SW called patient to assess food insecurity. SW called patient and patient's daughter, Alexandra, answered. Per SW conversation with Alexandra, there is no food insecurity in the household. Alexandra reported that patient's wife and family are constantly preparing meals for patient and trying to accommodate his wants.

Recently prescribed basal insulin (Basaglar pen 10 units QHS) but never started it.  Based on elevated A1c and recent FSBGs, recommend pt start insulin now, pt agreeable.  Prior note: Pt is resistant to sliding scale/meal time insulin as she found it too difficult to use in past.    -Prior note:  Pt has had frequent UTI's  and yeast infections but she attributes this to recent steroid injection.  Pt prefers to stay on Jardiance for now but may need to re-evaluate use in future if frequent UTIs/yeast infxns continue.    -Prior note:  Pt has food insecurity, as she does not qualify for food stamps and has limited income due to disability. Modifying diet and exercise will be difficult for patient, although discussed some possible options such as finding healthier items to eat on fast food menu and considering some resistance training or arm/leg lifts. Prior note:  Also expresses much worry throughout the appointment, which could be contributing to high blood sugars from poor diet and stress. Pt has seen the Social Worker, last visit was 2/16/21 -- encourage pt to f/u with SW as needed.      Plan   1) Diabetes Mellitus  - Medications:      CONTINUE Trulicity 4.5 mg SC qSundays, metformin 1000 mg BID; glipizide 10 mg XL BID; empagliflozin 25 mg daily.     START Basaglar insulin pen 10 units QHS - Rx sent to pharmacy  - Monitoring: restart home monitoring -  Check BG twice daily before breakfast and dinner (for basal insulin or other orals); keep log and have available for next visit.    - Limit carbohydrates to 45 grams per meal for women and 15 grams per snack.  Continue to f/u with dietitian as scheduled  - Incorporate at least 30 min of moderate exercise on most days of the week. Prior note: Suggested resistance bands, arm and leg lifts; finding other exercises she is able to do w/ her physical limitations.

He has an unfortunate history of cervical paraspinal stage IIIA DLBCL s/p RCHOP (2013)  and most recently stage III left pyriform sinus SCC s/p chemoXRT (finished 9/2021).    He is doing well overall, feels that the majority of his sx are related to radiation side effects (finished about 4 months ago) but are slowly improving. Repeat PET scan in March 2022. Feels that he is returning to his baseline and has great energy. His hair is growing back faster than when he was treated for lymphoma.    He reports tight posterior neck muscles for which he is seeing PT at Stanford q2weeks involving neck ROM exercises that seem to be helping. Tightness is worst with cspine extension and less noticeable with rotation, flexion, or lateral flexion. He reports being able to look over his shoulder when driving without discomfort. PT anticipates about 1 year for this to resolve.    He struggled with low appetite and swallowing difficulties that necessitated PEG placement (now removed 2-3 weeks ago). Healing well without e/o infection. Swallowing improving but occasionally notes tightness with large pills. Eating regularly with no N/V or choking sensation. Appetite is at or higher than baseline. Saw OT who recommended swallow study, scheduled 3/1/22. His weight today is improving, now 134 up from nadir of 110.     Also reports dry mouth for which he is using biotene mouth wash and lozenges. Diffuse muscle aches worst in BUE (shoulders and biceps), improving. Weakness now 3-4/10 with no difficulties rising from seated or writing. Some exertional fatigue that is manageable.

Respiratory: Approximately 30 minutes after delivery, the infant was noted to have moderate respiratory distress and hypoxemia to the 60s on RA. She was begun on NCPAP for 7 hours with marked improvement. However, an attempt to discontinue NCPAP at this point led to a recurrance of her respiratory distress so she received 4 additional hours of HFNC of 4LPM RA with successful resolution of all respiratory symptoms. Her initial CBG was 7.32/43/BE-3.5 and her CXR was consistent with TTN to my reading.  Cardiovascular: She has been hemodynamically stable since admission with normal BPs. The radiologist did note moderate cardiomegaly on her CXR but that the findings could be consistent with TTN. She has had no signs of a murmur or  congenital heart disease.  ID: An initial CBC was reassuring with a WBC of 8.8K and 49% neutrophils and 1% bands. She is at very low risk of EOS as her mother had ROM during her C-section at the time of delivery. A blood culture shows no growth at discharge and she received no empiric antibiotic therapy. An MRSA screening test was negative.  Heme: Her hematocrit after delivery was 43. Her TcB was 5.9 at 24 hours of age which is LIR.  Neuro: No concerns  HCM: Her first hearing screen referred on the right ear. Another screen will be performed before discharge.She had her newborn screen on 1/5/22, passed her CCHD screen and received ophthalmic ointment and her first HBV vaccine after delivery.    Family screened negative for food insecurity.

Severe protein calorie malnutrition     Stage of Change:   -Contemplation:  Not considering change within the next month.     Nutrition Interventions (Recommendations)   I discussed and reviewed with the patient:   - high calorie high protein MNT with goal for small, frequent meals and snacks, high calorie high protein beverages  - MNT for renal diet on dialysis       Goals/Recommendations:  For now, the most important thing to do for your health is to get more calories and food in however you can! We will continue to watch your labs for your diabetes and dialysis, but please focus on eating when and whatever you can (within reason regarding sodium). Focus on high protein foods and trying your best to eat consistently throughout the day. I know it's hard, but ask your friend and boyfriend for help with shopping/meals as you can. When your body does not have enough food to fuel itself, it is hard to do any healing and you'll continue to lose muscle mass and energy. Please see below for the suggestions  and recommendations we discussed. I'm sending this to you via hard copy/physical mail as well as via MyHealth, per your request.     Recommendations:  - Focus on food as medicine; you need sufficient calories and protein to run your body, especially as you are going through dialysis treatments which require more protein and calories     - A few lower sodium options for your breakfast meal and snacks: candian bacon, ham, turkey bacon, hash browns (ask for no added salt), low or no added salt nuts, low sodium cheese and deli meats   > buy no added salt peanut butter    > ask for low sodium menu at restaurants    - Follow up with the dietitian at your dialysis center: request to be seen to ask questions and your diet   > ask about salt, phosphorous, potassium levels based on your recent labs   > high protein diet, options within your food preferences (also see the handout I'm sending you for options)   > food resources (also see below for suggestions)    - Try your best to go to the food bank regularly to get grocery products that you like and know how to use/prepare    - A few meal delivery options:    - Mom's meals: https://www.momsmeals.com/   - Meals on Wheels: https://socialservices.sccgov.org/food-assistance/meals-on-wheels    - Online shopping options: Amazon Fresh, Safeway, Sprouts, InstaCart    > ask your friend and/or boyfriend to help you with online shopping OR make shopping lists for them to help go to the store   > focus on simple, high protein foods you can buy and make at home.     > Grocery list: peanut butter and jelly for sandwiches, bread, nuts, paper plates   > zoom in your screen on your phone to enlarge so you can see the options better     - I will send via mail a detailed handout on kidney disease and dialysis; food recommended/not, protein options and protein and calorie needs: Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3-5 Nutrition Therapy (NCM)    - when you are ready, reach out to your primary care  doctor about getting a new referral for physical therapy to help stop muscle mass loss/helpw with your daily activities     - find a high protein beverage you like and can include daily to ensure appropriate calories and protein    I gave the following handouts:  renal diet (NCM)  There are no Patient Instructions on file for this visit.

She compensated per Dr. Ghaziani's work up and has been ruled out for other causes of chronic liver disease.   -Not a candidate for vitamin E given her cirrhosis.     #Obesity class 3/glucose control:  -No hx of pre-DM or DM2 based on her A1c from a year ago. Ordered a repeat A1c.   -Would benefit from a minimum 10% total body weight loss (~26 lbs) to help reverse NASH cirrhosis.   -She's been unsuccessful in maintaining healthy dietary changes. Patient and daughter endorses emotional overeating. Relates this to her history of food insecurity as a child. After a long discussion she was open to seeing a local behavioral therapist to help address this. She will discuss a referral with her PCP to find a resource covered by her insurance. Will message her PCP about this as well. In addition, recommend trying a referral to the SHC Adult Eating and Weight Disorders Clinic.  Her insurance likely does not cover their clinic's service, but informed them we can at least try and see.   -GLP-1 pharmacotherapy may be helpful in having her reduce her portions and temper her overeating. I cautioned her though that she will need to learn to eat slowly and avoid large portions in one sitting as it will otherwise cause her nausea and vomiting. She does not have any contraindications to GLP-1 therapy (compensated cirrhosis). Main barrier would be insurance. HPSM medi-cal can cover it as long as it's stated that she's not a candidate for orlistat or phentermine, which she's not due to her cirrhosis and CV risk. Additionally, she meets BMI criteria and has already trialed lifestyle modifications. Managed medi-cal plans have transitioned to medi-cal rx singular state formulary as of this year though so there may be difference in coverage. She will be seeing the weight management clinic next week. Will relay recommendations to them for consideration. She would also benefit from  working closely with a nutritionist through their clinic.   -Will refer her to our fatty liver education classes.     #Blood pressure control:   -BPs are not well controlled.   -She's currently on lisiinopril 20mg daily, metoprolol succinate 50mg daily, and HCTZ 25mg daily.   -Asked her to monitor BPs at home. They will purchase a BP monitor and check once weekly and report readings to her PCP.   -Education on accurate BP monitoring technique provided.    #Lipid control:   -Moderate intensity statin may be considered based on her 10 yr ASCVD risk score (intermediate risk) per ACC/AHA guidelines.   -Ok to hold off for now while focusing on weight loss interventions. Last lipid panel largely normal.     #Health maintenance:   -Up to date on pertinent vaccines.   -On vitamin D supplementation for history of deficiency.        Follow-up: None needed at this time. Patient and daughter informed that they can reach out to me on myhealth to reconnect should they have any questions.      Plan of care discussed.  Pt verbalized an understanding.

Multiple hepatic metastases are seen, largest measuring 1.0 cm. 2.  Increasing size of the perinephric nodule posterior to the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 5 mm, previously hypermetabolic on the PET/CT, likely an additional site of metastasis. 3.  Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis likely due to the pelvic mass. 4.  No hepatic steatosis,, with hepatic fat fraction of less than 5%. 5.  No hepatic iron overload.

Left pelvic mass is enlarged from 9/19/2021 and consistent with biopsy-proven sarcoma, with left-sided hydroureter. 2.  Focal hypermetabolic uptake hepatic segment 7 raises suspicion for hepatic metastatic disease. More definitive anatomic evaluation can be obtained by MRI abdomen. 3.  Additional hypermetabolic focus along the posterior aspect of the right superior kidney may represent an additional site of metastasis.  Although too small to characterize, and potential follow-up is recommended. 4.  Mildly hypermetabolic left axillary lymph node could be related to recent vaccination. Correlate with history. 5.  Focus of hypermetabolism in a left anterior maxillary tooth likely represents dental disease. I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree with the report transcribed above.

Oxygenation was given via nasal cannula and the patient was monitored closely with pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and vital signs, by an independent, trained, qualified observer throughout the procedure to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.  Full details are available in the procedure log and report. Moderate sedation medications Fentanyl (mcg): 0 Versed (mg): 2 Hydromorphone (mg): 1  Physician/Patient face-to-face sedation start time:  2:33 PM Physician/Patient face-to-face sedation end time:  3:04 PM Duration of anesthesia/sedation: 31 minutes  I, John Louie, attest that I personally evaluated the patient's airway and was present for continuous 1:1 monitoring throughout the entire procedure and while sedation was being administered. The above times reflect physician/patient face-to-face time. Medications: Local anesthetic: 1. Lidocaine 1% 2. No additional local anesthetic used Antibiotics: Cefazolin Contrast: 1. Isovue  8 mL 2. No additional contrast used Other Medications: 1. No additional medications used 2. No additional medications used Informed consent obtained from: Patient Interpreter: Yes Prior to the start of the procedure, all Universal Protocol steps, including a pre-procedure verification process, verification of the procedure site, and a time-out were performed with all relevant personnel in the room. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were used, including hand hygiene and cutaneous antisepsis. PROCEDURE COMMENTS AND FINDINGS: DRAIN PLACEMENT Access side: Left Access site: Flank Access imaging guidance: Fluoroscopy and Ultrasound. Images were saved and stored in PACS Access needle: Greb set Access wire: Amplatz Wire size:  0.035 New tube: Nephrostomy New tube size (French): 10.2 New tube length (cm): 25 Nephrostogram performed: Yes Findings: Pre-procedure US showed moderately dilated collecting system in left kidney. The left kidney lower pole calyx was selected by 22G In-Rad under direct US guidance. Gentle contrast injection from the needle showed opacification of the collecting system and proximal ureter. The In-Rad needle was exchanged to Grab set. After tract dilation, a 10.2 Fr x 25 cm MPD catheter was placed over Amplatz wire. The retention loop was formed in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed good location. Dilated left ureter with distal obstruction in the pelvis was noted. Fluid was sent for culture. The drain was collected to gravity bag, secured to skin by suture. Clean dressing was applied. Intraprocedural complications: None IMPRESSION: Moderate left hydronephrosis with distal ureteral obstruction in the pelvis. Technically successful left nephrostomy placement using 10.2 Fr x 25 cm MPD catheter. PLAN: -Keep nephrostomy to gravity bag. Flush with normal saline TID until clear.

Multiple hepatic metastases are seen, largest measuring 1.0 cm. 2.  Increasing size of the perinephric nodule posterior to the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 5 mm, previously hypermetabolic on the PET/CT, likely an additional site of metastasis. 3.  Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis likely due to the pelvic mass. 4.  No hepatic steatosis,, with hepatic fat fraction of less than 5%. 5.  No hepatic iron overload.

Left pelvic mass is enlarged from 9/19/2021 and consistent with biopsy-proven sarcoma, with left-sided hydroureter. 2.  Focal hypermetabolic uptake hepatic segment 7 raises suspicion for hepatic metastatic disease. More definitive anatomic evaluation can be obtained by MRI abdomen. 3.  Additional hypermetabolic focus along the posterior aspect of the right superior kidney may represent an additional site of metastasis.  Although too small to characterize, and potential follow-up is recommended. 4.  Mildly hypermetabolic left axillary lymph node could be related to recent vaccination. Correlate with history. 5.  Focus of hypermetabolism in a left anterior maxillary tooth likely represents dental disease. I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree with the report transcribed above.

The above times reflect physician/patient face-to-face time. Medications: Local anesthetic: 1. Lidocaine 1% 2. No additional local anesthetic  used Antibiotics: Cefazolin Contrast: 1. Isovue  8 mL 2. No additional contrast used Other Medications: 1. No additional medications used 2. No additional medications used Informed consent obtained from: Patient Interpreter: Yes Prior to the start of the procedure, all Universal Protocol steps, including a pre-procedure verification process, verification of the procedure site, and a time-out were performed with all relevant personnel in the room. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were used, including hand hygiene and cutaneous antisepsis. PROCEDURE COMMENTS AND FINDINGS: DRAIN PLACEMENT Access side: Left Access site: Flank Access imaging guidance: Fluoroscopy and Ultrasound. Images were saved and stored in PACS Access needle: Greb set Access wire: Amplatz Wire size: 0.035 New tube: Nephrostomy New tube size (French): 10.2 New tube length (cm): 25 Nephrostogram performed: Yes Findings: Pre-procedure US showed moderately dilated collecting system in left kidney. The left kidney lower pole calyx was selected by 22G In-Rad under direct US guidance. Gentle contrast injection from the needle showed opacification of the collecting system and proximal ureter. The In-Rad needle was exchanged to Grab set. After tract dilation, a 10.2 Fr x 25 cm MPD catheter was placed over Amplatz wire. The retention loop was formed in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed good location. Dilated left ureter with distal obstruction in the pelvis was noted. Fluid was sent for culture. The drain was collected to gravity bag, secured to skin by suture. Clean dressing was applied. Intraprocedural complications: None IMPRESSION: Moderate left hydronephrosis with distal ureteral obstruction in the pelvis. Technically successful left nephrostomy placement using 10.2 Fr x 25 cm MPD catheter. PLAN: -Keep nephrostomy to gravity bag. Flush with normal saline TID until clear. Record output. -Routine exchange every 2-3 months if  long term nephrostomy needed. In the future, an interpreter will be required. For future examinations, general anesthesia will not be required.

Endorses taking escitalopram 5 mg daily with recent attempt to increase to 10 mg but had complaints of dizziness.  Â   On interview,Â patient reportsÂ that she recently has been having a lot of issues functioning. Â She reports most recently that she spent the entire previous day mentally going over what she needed to do, which was called the IRS to get extension on her taxes. Â She has been working with a PhD at the Center For independence of adults individuals with disabilitiesÂ (CIID)Â who has been helping her use certain strategies to be more organized such as driving down staff. Â When trying to complete this task today was spent filling out her schedule in which she got distracted easily. Â She reports that she ended up watching this hoarders on Netflix from 7:30 PM to 1:30 AM until her computer died. Â She then was not able to get out of bed until 2:30 PM the next day and when she had a massive headache and muscle tension in her neck. Â She states that many days are like this a cycle of being mentally exhausted and then physically exhausted as a consequence. Â She describes her household as very chaotic and riddled with paperwork. Â She states that after watching initial hoarder she believes that she might have a hoarding issue as well. Â But she states that one of her time is spent trying to take care of her and her daughter for which she is a single mother.  Â   She she describes financial difficulties that have been plaguing her for the past year and a half. Â She states that she was  never able to get a job after law school after failing the bar 5 times due to what she now understands her ADHD issues. Â She reports that she has no income and placed emphasis on """"having no income at all """". Â She denies any social supports from her father or her sister. Â She states that when she asked her dad if her and her daughter could live with her when COVID hit he said """"Of course my granddaughter to live with me butÂ whereÂ will you live?"""" Â She states this was not a joke and that this was his response when she asked a second time. Â She still describes her sister as avoidantÂ and says that she has issues of her own. Â   Â   She reports that she came here today because she felt like she mentally had to do something to take care of herself. Â Her daughter is currently with her ex-husband for the next week and she says that this is the only time in the whole year that she will have time to clean her home or do anything that she needs to do. Â She expresses frustration that she is not been able to clean or get anything done and states that she feels like the systems are not giving her the support that she needs.  Â   In terms of supports she does have, she reports that she takes Lexapro 5 mg daily and that she recently decreased it from 10 mg after feeling dizzy and lightheaded and having a fainting spell. Â She has a appointment with Dr. Herbert from San Mateo clinic on 13 January to discuss medications. Â She states that she was officially diagnosed ADHD 4 years ago by parent but had been following the diagnosis for many years before that. Â She describes trying medications like Focalin and Adderall Strattera but denies them really working for her. Â She reports that she has been following physician from the East Coast and ADHD coaches who said that she needs help be on medications and therapy, but she struggles to figure out how to get that supportive help that she needs. Â She states that providers have told her in the past  that she needs a secretary but is unable to find something to help.  Â   Although she has appointments coming up with healthcare providers, and even a therapy appointment with her sister tomorrow, the patient reports that many of her care providers are retiring and does not take any confidence in the benefits of medication or therapy in helping her in the long run. Â When asked if she feels hopeless she states that she feels like she is just """"hanging on at this point.""""    She describes passive suicidal ideations and is having thoughts of that she does not want to wait. Â She describes sleep disturbances and spending a lot of time into bed as well as low energy she denies feeling depressed all the time and says that some days she feels better than others. Â She denies any access to firearms and says that her protective factor is her daughter. Â She does say she feels as if she leaves today with no hope that she will feel like he really is not any thing that can help her from now on. Â She says she feels hopeful when she thinks about the work that she could do advocating for people like her and making a difference but she states that her inability to function makes this a farfetched idea.  Â   This morning,Â patient recounted much of what she discussed with the psychiatric resident overnight. Â She feels Basista by multiple sources of stress and inability to concentrate. Â She feels entirely overwhelmed by the demands of her life. Â She has been unable to work for 5 years due to poor concentration and untreated ADHD. Â Patient feels alone and isolated due to ongoing family discord. Â This morning patient denies any desire to harm herself, citing her child as a protective factor. Â Nevertheless she feels entirely hopeless and not wanting to be alive. Â Patient willing to sign in the hospital voluntary for treatment  Â ---------------------------- end extraction ---------------------------------   Â   Â   On interview, pt corroborates  the above. States over the last few months, she's 'really been struggling' with depression, anxiety and frustration over her ability to function in life. Indicates she has not been able to work for the past 5 years due to failing the bar exam and mounting financial pressures and need to care for her 8 year old daughter have been taking a toll on her. Notes she had an argument with her father on Sunday and began noticing tension in her neck/back/shoulders after that. She realized all the tension she'd been carrying, felt hopeless and endorsed passive SI without intent or plan. Ultimately realized she needed to come to hospital for additional help.   Â   Depression: +low mood, amotivation, apathy, feelings guilt/worthlessness, hopeless, passive SI  Â   Anxious: + restless, pressured speech, overwhelm, worry, body tension  Â   Reports hx ADHD (cannot remember when diagnosed or when started taking meds), but endorses she first understood herself to have ADHD in 2005 after law school at an evaluation given on campus. Later prescribed strattera, concerta, adderrall, cannot indicate if any worked well and also does not recall if she had a full adequate trial of any of these. Pt notably very tangential and restless in interview.   Â   Medication wise, pt only taking Lexapro5mg presently. Reports recent lightheadedness when taking both lexapro and wellbutrin simulateously and one episode syncope in which she fell and hit L shoulder (requests xray to evaluate).

Her mood/anxiety were targeted with increase in her PTA lexapro to 15mg daily. Pt reported episodes of orthostasis that occurred with previous attempts to uptitrate her medication. Orthostatic vital signs were monitored on unit and were within normal limits. She reported some subjective moments of lightheadedness but managed with hydration and continued PO intake. She reported improvement in her mood and anxiety during her hospitalization.    Patient was started on ritalin 20mg daily on 1/6 to target ADHD symptoms. Team meeting was held with SW, attending and myself (resident) to discuss ways pt may access her current outpatient resources. At time of discharge, pt no longer endorsed a sense of hopelessness and reported improvement in her mood, anxiety and attention.

Thought content: No SI or HI, endorsed bed-bound 'hopelessness' on admission, no auditory or visual hallucinations   Insight: intact   Judgement: intact   Orientation: AOx4   Attention: appropriate     Suicide Risk Assessment at  Discharge:  This assessment was performed after a suicide safety plan was performed.    Risk State (Acute Risk)  The patient's acute risk state appears to be similar to her baseline state, based on my analysis of her risk and protective factors. The following risk factors increase her acute risk state: none    Meanwhile, the following protective factors diminish her acute risk state: lack of psychosis, future orientation (toward caring for daughter), family/loved ones/support, therapeutic alliance and engagement, medication adherence, willingness to engage in suicide safety planning. Of note, the patient has not made any suicidal gestures or required emergent medications in the last 48 hours. The patient currently plans to follow up with the recommended outpatient care plan.    Patient was able to engage in suicide safety planning and contingency management. As such, risk was further mitigated by the following interventions during this hospitalization: psychopharmaceuticals, brief supportive therapy, recruitment of social supports, arranged clinical follow-up    Risk Status (Chronic Risk)  The patient's chronic risk status is elevated above that of the general population (especially given recent hospital encounter and history of psychiatric disorder), and lower than that of typical patients on the inpatient service due to the following risk factors: chronic depression    On my assessment, she is not LPS holdable at this time.

Recently patient reports hearing voices that are different than recent baseline. Prior auditory hallucinations had improved with medication for the last few months. But starting around yesterday they became stronger, making them scared. The voices have  been telling Pt to stab themselves with sharps objects when parents are not in the room. Pt reported that the voices have become increasingly intense over the past two days, and they are having more difficulty refraining from acting upon them.       Pt also reports own SI thoughts in addition to voices. The severity of patient's SI can fluctuate, but have worsened with the onset of the hallucinations, becoming hard to ignore. Endorses feeling SI every day. Pt reports a plan to sneak out of  their  house and jump off an overpass. Had this thought for the last few days. Pt thinks it would be feasible to sneak out, as they expressed confidence in their ability to leave the house at night without awakening their parents or grandparents. Has not written  a note, or given away possessions, no date set, but planning to carry out soon. Last time patient felt like this with this intensity was when they had to be hospitalized in September of 2021 (Fremont Hospital). The patient stated that they previously  attempted to kill themselves by choking themselves, but they """"passed out.""""      In reviewing current symptoms, patient describes their current mood as """"depressed,"""" reports that it is hard to be happy. Sleep is """"alright."""" Gets about 9 hrs/night, doesn't feel like it's good sleep, """"I'm always constantly tired."""" Sometimes overeats,  sometimes undereats, can vary with mood. Concentration is """"not very good,"""" which happens with depressive episodes. Endorses increasing thoughts of death, as well as SI as above, intensity of these thoughts is significantly worse than baseline today. Patient  endorses feelings of guilt as well. Currently patient having trouble with ADLs/iADLs as a result, such as brushing teeth or showering, these feel like they take too much energy.      Patient interestingly also endorses periods (up to 2 days) of decreased sleep with euphoric symptoms then followed by a """"crash"""" into a significant depression. During these periods of up they feel like they can do anything, possibly even fly. They do lots  of cleaning and reorganizing of their room during these periods. They go out and are more social than usual. They go shopping and spend lots of money, leading to feelings of regret afterwards. They have stolen their mom's credit card to buy things during  these periods. The last episode was about a month ago. These episodes happen every 1-2 months.       Squid endorses recent visual hallucinations.  They report seeing a person following them around that others cannot see. This person used to make them feel """"uncomfortable,"""" but they stated that they are now used to it. They last saw this person approximately  one week ago.       Patient's mother reports that they live in small apartment shared with mother, father, and 2 paternal grandparents. Paternal grandmother has a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Mother notes it is small apartment. Sharps and medications are in a locked cabinet.  Mother reports there is always at least one person at home. Mother reports that patient (she prefers to call Carina, although will make effort to call """"Squid"""" in patient's presence) does not share many of their symptoms with their parents, making difficult  to know what is going on with patient's mental health.      Review of Systems:    A complete 14-point review of systems is negative, except as noted in the HPI.      Pertinent Past Medical, Psychiatric, Substance, Family, and Social History:     Past Medical History:        Diagnosis  Date         ?  Abdominal pain       ?  Chronic constipation       ?  Food intolerance       ?  Heartburn           ?  Poor appetite          No past surgical history on file.      The pt meets regularly with their outpatient psychiatrist and therapist at Stanford. Assessment in most recent psychiatry note:    """"15 yo F without a past hx of psychiatric evaluation or treatment. Carina reported that she suffered sexual trauma in the 6th grade. Prior to the trauma, Carina was described as being emotionally stable, without anxiety or sleep issues. After experiencing  the trauma, Carina described symptoms of PTSD. While symptoms have improved over the years, they still remain. Carina reported difficulties with mood, anxiety and sleep for the past several years. She turned to drugs and ETOH to cope with her emotions.  Carina only recently informed her mother about the trauma and drug/ETOH use. Carina is  currently engaged in counseling services through her Church, where she is drug tested frequently. Carina stated a desire for further help. Mother said that she was  not interested in medication management at this time, but was interested in therapy services for trauma and substance use.""""      PTSD in discussion with patient results in episodes of memory loss, disassociation. """"Sometimes I completely forget who I am."""" Can be more forgetful in general. Pt also experiences symptoms of hyperarousal in response to reminders of the traumatic event  (eg, heart racing, sweating).      Substance abuse history per patient was """"a long time ago."""" No substance use since 8th grade, when they took marijuana, adderall, and possibly synthetic opioids. Last EtOH was in 8th or 9th grade. Denies any current cravings or desire to begin using substances  again.      Patient currently in online school. This is fully online school, rather than regular school that is online for Covid-19. Only taking 1 class currently. Patient says this is not stressful. Pt stated that they do not have any friends, but noted that their  older brother and his wife provide some emotional support.       Not currently in any romantic relationship. Patient reports that last romantic relationship was in freshman year of high school. Dated a girl, also a freshman, for a few months. Says that partner would sometimes hurt them, slapping in the face; pt stated  that the slaps may have led to bruising. The pt no longer has any contact with this person.       Home there is mother, father, 2 grandparents. Sometimes there are arguments per patient, improved from before, but still sometimes occur. Patient reports feeling safe at home. Does not feel unwanted. Does not endorse food insecurity. Patient does not  endorse any episodes of unwanted touching or abuse (with the exception of the sexual trauma she experienced in 6th grade, documented in chart).

Patient reports command auditory hallucinations telling them to stab themselves with a sharp object when  no one is around; pt shared that these voices/commands are getting increasingly hard to ignore. Patient also reports exacerbation of underlying SI with more intense and frequent thoughts of sneaking out at night to jump off nearby overpass, which Pt believes  they could feasibly carry out, and which they plan to do imminently. The last time they experienced these symptoms of this severity they required inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. The patient  requires inpatient hospitalization for monitoring and safety planning, given their imminent risk of harm to self.      Pt meets criteria for major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, given their symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, hopelessness for the future, low energy,  insomnia/hypersomnia, changes in eating behavior that correspond with mood, challenges related to  concentration, and suicidal ideation (with active plan and intent). Further consideration of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder may be warranted due to pt's repeated experiences of 2-day periods with elevated mood, inflated self-esteem, and increased risk-taking  behavior (leading to negative consequences), goal-directed activity, and sociability. Finally, the patient has a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, as they experienced sexual trauma in 6th grade and experience continued symptoms of dissociation,  negative mood (associated with the event), and hyperarousal (racing heart, sweating at reminders of event).      Diagnostic Impressions:     Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe   PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder)    R/o bipolar disorder with psychotic features      Safety Risk Assessment:   Danger to self given the following factors:  suicidal ideation, plan and intent; ability to carry out plan to harm self; limited communication with caregivers so not able to monitor symptoms and prevent injury; limited social support; hopelessness about their future      Plan/Recommendations:   The patient requires inpatient hospitalization for monitoring and safety planning, given imminent risk of self-harm.

That way we can make the most of our time together.     Gaining Weight the Healthy Way  Being underweight can be unhealthy.  If you are underweight, you may be slower to recover from illness. You may have more complications with surgery. Underweight women may stop menstruating or have complications with pregnancy.  Anyone who has a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 is underweight, under federal health guidelines. Your BMI is based on your height and weight.  If you are underweight, there are healthy ways to gain weight. Some people want to gain weight or add muscle even if they are not underweight.  Athletes may want more muscle to help them perform their sport better. Whatever the reason, itÂ¿s better to gain weight in a healthy way.  A sound weight gain program combines exercise with good food. Exercise can boost muscles. Balanced meals give you nutrients for energy and muscle growth.  Adding 250 to 500 calories per day will cause you to gain about 0.5 to 1 pound per week. This number may vary depending on your activity level and genetic makeup.  What is a balanced food plan?  Eating more calories than you burn will cause you to gain weight. ThatÂ¿s true no matter what type of food you eat.  You will be stronger in nutrition, though, if you get most of those calories from certain food groups. The best food groups include:  Â· Whole grains  Â· Fruits and vegetables  Â· Dairy or nondairy substitutes  Â· Meat and plant proteins  WhatÂ¿s the best way to increase calories?  Most healthy people donÂ¿t need expensive, specialized weight-gain formulas. Extra calories can easily be added through food.  To avoid feeling stuffed, add small amounts of food you already like to your usual meals. Aim to eat an extra 250 to 500 calories per day.  Try to eat about every 3 hours. Those extra calories will  add up!  Here are some ideas to get you started.  Grains:Â   Â· Heavy, thick breads like whole wheat, pumpernickel, or rye  Â· Specialty breads with added nuts or seeds, which have extra oils and fats  Whole wheat walnut, pumpkin, or banana bread  Â· Dense cereals such as grape nuts, granola, and raisin bran  Â· Bran muffins, bagels  Â· Wheat germ and flaxseed  Added to yogurt or cereal, smoothies, oatmeal  Â· Quinoa, a high protein whole grain  Used in place of rice or mixed with veggies for a side dish  Per cup, 222 calories and 8 grams of protein (cooked)  Fruit:Â   Â· Bananas  Â· Pineapple  Â· Raisins and other dried fruit (apricots, cranberries, dates)  Â· Fruit juices  Â· Avocados, which are high in monounsaturated fat  Slices added to sandwiches or salads  Made into guacamole or a spread for crackers or toast  Added to Mexican soups or beans, or to smoothies or shakes  Vegetables:Â   Starchy veggies have more calories than nonstarchy ones  Â· Peas  Â· Corn  Â· Potatoes (russet, yams, sweet potato, red)  Loaded with buttery spread, brown sugar (yams), sour cream for even more calories  Â· Winter squash (pumpkin, butternut, kabocha, delicata)  Cubed and roasted in oven at 400Â°, cooled and added to salads  Inside cored, then add cooked quinoa, mixed veggies and parmesan  Roasted in oven until soft  Â· All beans except green beans  Â· Added gravies, sauces, or cheese on nonstarchy veggies  Load salads with beans, hardboiled egg, nuts, seeds  Â Dairy:Â   Â· Cheese  Â· Ice cream  Â· Frozen yogurt  Â· Instant breakfast mixes, powdered milk, or yogurt added to casseroles, soups, and mashed potatoes  Meat or plant proteins:Â   Â· Peanut butter and other nut butters (almond butter, seed butter)  About 100 calories in 1 tablespoonÂ   Spread on bread, with jelly or honey, with an apple or banana  Â· Nuts and seeds (walnuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios)  Make a trail mix with Â¼ cup nuts, Â¼ cup raisins, and Â½ cup granola  Â· Hummus - adding olive oil  for higher calorie density  Â· Pesto added to sandwiches, salad dressing, pasta, pizza (instead of lower calorie marinara)  Used as a dip for bread or veggies  Â· Chicken, turkey, lean beef (90% lean or more best), bison  Â· Fish, especially fatty fish high in omega-3 fats (salmon, chunk light or skipjack tuna, trout, sardines or anchovies)  Shrimp, crab, mussels or clams  Other foods:Â   Â· Any kind of instant breakfast or meal replacement drinks  Ensure Plus, Boost Very High Calorie, Orgain, Carnation Instant Breakfast  used like milk: poured into cold cereal or oatmeal, in coffee, added to smoothies (see below).Â You can find recipes on product websites  Â· Protein powder:  Mixed into soups, potatoes, smoothies, yogurts, puddings, ice cream or shakes  Â· Honey:Â   Mixed into smoothies or shakes, yogurt, tea  Â· Olive oil:  Dipped with bread, drizzled on frozen peas or other vegetables  Added to salads, soups, rice, smoothies, on fishÂ   Â Protein smoothie recipes:Â   Â· Fruit smoothie:  One cup fruit (such as bananas or berries) combined with 1 cup vanilla frozen yogurt, Â½ cup milk, Â¼ cup juice, and 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed pureed in a blender until smooth  You can also substitute vanilla yogurt with a soy or whey-based protein powder (try Trader JoeÂ¿s or Designer Whey or unflavored Beneprotein)  Â· Smoothie base:  Greek yogurt, 1 fruit, 1 tablespoon peanut butter or olive oil or avocado, juice or milk or Ensure or other supplement, all blended together  Â· Green smoothie:  1/2 to 1 cup liquid base (milk, soy milk, 100%Â juice,Â Ensure)  ?

Clinician explained nature of clinical notes and explained that they are a part of the electronic health record and are available to members of the Stanford Health Care Cardiovascular Clinic, as well as other providers within the Stanford Health Care system.  The patient verbalized understanding and agreement.  Clinician notified the patient of the limits of confidentiality (information about suspected child or elder abuse, or credible information that the patient is in imminent danger or harming self or others cannot be kept confidential).  The patient verbalized understanding, agreed and gave verbal consent to treat. Patient agrees to call 911 and present to the nearest ED if feeling unsafe.     Per chart review, Juan Andres Chavez-Rivas is a 55 Y male with a medical history significant  ETOH abuse, HTN, CAD (negative cath 6/2020), AF with RVR, possible cardiac syncope with AV block and s/p MDT DC ICD Implant 6/18/2020, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, intermittent/reversible thrombocytopenia s/p successful Watchman implantation on 2/16/2021 who was seen at the Cardiovascular clinic last week for follow up after hospital admission for ETOH intoxication and suspected misfire of AICD.     Mr. Juan Chavez is a 55 year old male who resides in Redwood City and has been working as a contractor for the past several years. Unfortunately, in the last 3-4 months he has been homeless and in and out of motels. He was living with his sister, however due to relapse of  alcohol (sober for 6 months prior), his sister asked him to leave the house. His relapse was related to his wife divorcing him and taking their 5 year old daughter to Mexico to be with another man and also losing his mother recently. He denies SI/HI. He currently does not have a drivers licence and has been walking from Redwood City to his medical appointments. Writer informed him of the HPSM transportation benefit that he can utilize in order get to in person medical appointments for non emergency purposes.     Juan Andrea shared that a friend of his will be picking him up later this afternoon and will drive him to Fresno area to a residential program. This friend of his is sober and has helped others out in the area. It is a faith based residential program where you can go to church. Juan Andres shared that he is afraid to go, but finds that this may be a way of God helping him. Juan Andres practices faith and uses prayer as a way to cope. He shared that he has experienced a lot of change in the past two years which has impacted his mental health. Two years ago patient's mother passed away, he loss his job and his spouse in Guadalajara, Mx left him for another man. He started to multiple cans of beer every day to cope with the pain. He shared insight that the beer does not help him long term, but helps him in the moment forget about things.     Per chart review, patient has been referred to IOP and to also call the San Mateo County Access line in order to get started on the process of getting into a residential program. Juan Andres is very receptive to support at this time and is waiting for his friend to pick him up to go to a residential program in Fresno area. Though anxious about the program he is mainly interested in getting the help he needs to work through loss and the multiple adjustments in his life.     1/24/2022    Received phone call from Rory a case manager from Integrated Care Management from HPSM  requesting call back 650 661-2531. Spoke to Rory, patient requesting help for residential program in SMC area. Unclear if patient stayed at the residential program in Fresno. Per Rory, pt did not like the program because they were """"yelling at him"""". Rory shared that he would help the patient get into a program if he desires. Writer to further collaborate with outpatient case manager as needed.     PatientÂ¿s Identified Concerns and strengths:   1. """"I want to get help for this"""" (substance use; History of loss)     Presenting problem or symptoms:   1. History of loss; Substance use      MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   General appearance, attitude and behavior: patient was alert, conversant and cooperative during phone interview  Motor: Phone call  Speech:  Normal rate, rhythm, and volume   Mood: Anxious   Affect: Phone call   Thought process: Linear  Thought content: Denies current SI  Insight/judgement: Fair/fair     Goals:  """"I want to go to this place in Fresno next to a church""""      Objectives:  Patient independently making steps to getting care in Fresno area at a residential program that is also faith based. Patient unclear what residential program it is, but has transportation to and from.     Therapeutic Interventions:  Active Listening Techniques  Emotional Validation and Reassurance   Rapport building     Diagnosis:  See psychiatry notes from recent hospitalization     Next Appointment:      Time Spent:  80 minutes in direct service, 20 minutes documenting the encounter    Plan:  1.

"112",112,3911,FALSE,"","Cardiovascular Medicine    Visit Date: 1/18/2022  Visit Type: Follow Up    History of Present Illness:  Juan Andres Chavez-Rivas is a 55 Y male with a medical history significant  ETOHÂ abuse, HTN, CAD (negative cath 6/2020), AF with RVR, possible cardiac syncope with AV blockÂ and s/p MDT DC ICD Implant 6/18/2020, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, intermittent/reversible thrombocytopenia s/p successfulÂ Watchman implantationÂ on 2/16/2021 who presents today for follow up after hospital admission for ETOH intoxication and suspected misfire of AICD.     Prior History (adapted and updated as needed from Erin Li's prior note):   To recap, during admission for MVA with associated syncope with multiple rib fractures 01/23-01/27/20, he was found to have new onset Afib with RVR with possible cardiac syncope. No prior history of cardiac disease. During work up for Afib, echocardiogram revealed moderate to markedly reduced LV function with LVEF 35%. CT chest angiography showed moderate LAD atherosclerotic calcifications.  At that time, he was started on atorvastatin 80 mg, ASA 81 mg, Lopressor 25 mg daily, valsartan 20 mg daily for new onset cardiomyopathy suspected to be ischemic.    Completed PET/CT Viability 05/22/2020 which showed mild hypoperfusion within the inferior and inferior lateral walls of the LV suggesting viable myocardium in the majority of the LV.  To further assess for need for revascularization to improve LV function, he underwent a coronary angiogram on 06/04/2020 which showed no obstructive CAD and no revascularization needed.      ICD placed with Dr. Duy Nguyen for cardiac syncope on 06/18/2020 without complications    Interval History:  Juan Andres Chavez-Rivas was last seen in our clinic by Erin Li, NP on 07/08/2021 for follow up. The plan at that time was:   Sleep clinic follow up CPAP therapy   Continue valsartan 40 mg, Atorva 80 mg , ASA 81 mg   Increase Metoprolol to 100 mg XL daily, monitor home  BP/HR  Limited echo LV function 6 months   Repeat lipid panel, CMP 6 months   Reejhsinghani/Bruhnke 6 months     Since his last visit, he has unfortunately had 2 recent hospital admissions for atrial fibrillation RVR in setting of ETOH overuse and medication non-compliance (12/24/2021 and 01/08/2021). Since his latest admission, patient has been taking his medications without missed doses and denies any cardiac symptoms.     Unfortunately, in the last 3-4 months he has been homeless and in and out of motels. He was living with his sister, however due to relapse of alcohol (sober for 6 months prior), his sister asked him to leave the house. His relapse was related to his wife divorcing him and taking their 5 year old daughter to Mexico to be with another man and also losing his mother recently. He denies SI/HI.      Had started using CPAP 1-2 months prior and loved it. Unfortunately several weeks ago, it was stolen from a motel room and he has been unable to use. Has not notified sleep clinic about this yet.     Medication Adherence: no missed doses of cardiac medications in the last 10 days since hospital discharge. Denies any medication side effects including bleeding/brusing.   Cardiac Symptoms:  Denies chest pain, DOE, orthopnea, edema, dizziness/LH, syncope or presyncope, stroke-like symptoms.   HTN: Due to homelessness, has not been able to check blood pressures recently. Takes Valsartan 40mg/day and metop succ 100mg/day.   Lipid: Is back to taking atorvastatin 80 mg daily for the last 10 days which tolerates well (previously was off of this intermittently for several months). Last lipids 1/2022 LDL 88, HDL 80, TG 153.   Activity: No formal exercise due to complex social stressors currently. Is doing a lot of walking as he doesn't have transportation currently. For example, last week when he came to Stanford in Palo Alto for his echo, he actually walked there from his truck in Redwood city (round trip took 5.5  hours). He denies any exertional cardiac symptoms with this level of activity and reports stable exercise tolerance.   ETOH: Has cut back significantly since hospitalization and is now drinking 2 beers/day, on Naltrexone 50mg/day. Contemplative about complete cessation. Interested in residential treatment, but unsure how to proceed.

ASSESSMENT:   Juan Andres Chavez-Rivas is a 55 Y male with a medical history significant  ETOHÂ abuse, HTN, CAD (negative cath 6/2020), AF with RVR, possible cardiac syncope with AV blockÂ andÂ cardiomyopathy s/p MDT DC ICD Implant 6/18/2020, with intermittent/reversible thrombocytopenia s/p successfulÂ Watchman implantationÂ on 2/16/2021 who presents today for follow up after hospital admission for ETOH intoxication and misfire of AICD.     HFrEF: Most recent echo earlier this week (1/2022) with LVEF drop from 53% to 47%, likely in setting of medication non-compliance and alcohol overuse. Given his angiogram in 06/2020 revealed minimal, non-obstructive CAD, etiology most likely alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Asymptomatic at this time and since hospital discharge has been compliant with all cardiac medications. Unfortunately, he continues to drink alcohol but has thankfully cut down intake significantly to two beers each day (down from 36 beers daily). Congratulated him on this accomplishment.     Recall, his cardiomyopathy was diagnosed 01/2020 and prior cardiac w/u has included: echocardiogram 01/24/2020 with LVEF of 35%, global LV dysfunction with dyssynchrony and apical/septal hypokinesis. He then completed a CCTA in  04/14/20 showing moderate to severe CAD of LAD, RCA, Cx with no LM disease and calcium score 1129. A subsequent limited echocardiogram was completed 04/07/20 which  showed recovery of LVEF to 43%, most likely due to alcohol cessation at that time.  He then completed PET/CT heart viability study which showed mild hypoperfusion with in the inferior and inferior lateral walls of the LV suggesting viable myocardium in the majority of the LV.  To further assess for need for revascularization, he underwent a coronary angiogram on 06/04/2020 which showed no obstructive CAD.  Given no obstructive CAD present, would support alcoholic cardiomyopathy.     Currently taking GDMT including valsartan 40 mg, metoprolol 100 mg XL daily, atorvastatin 80 mg, ASA 81 mg. Reinforced again the importance of alcohol cessation, which he is working on. To optimize HF regimen would consider addition of spironolactone, however given recent housing and food  Instability, will defer additional medication changes and re-consider pending results of his next echocardiogram in 3 months time, which will re-assess his LVEF.    Afib with RVR s/p Watchman: on ASA 81 mg metoprolol 75 mg XL daily. S/p ICD given h/o cardiac syncope. Multiple recent admissions for A fib RVR + ICD misfire in setting of ETOH overuse and medication non-compliance. EP was consulted during most recent admission earlier this month and were concerned that changes to the VF zone or other VT/VF discriminators programmed in the device would risk forfeiting protection from true VT/VF events in the future. They also considered cardioversion with dofetilide, however there was concern about medication adherence and ultimately, a rate control stratigy for his AF was recommended. Patient is followed by Dr. Duy Nguyen EP and we encouraged him to schedule follow up in light of recent hospitalizations and we much appreciate Dr. Nguyen's recommendations.     OSA: confirmed on sleep study 08/2020. Severe. Followed in sleep clinic by Dr. Kawai and recently started using his CPAP about 1-2 months ago, however this was unfortunately stolen out of a motel room  recently. Advised he reach out to Dr. Kawai to alert him and discuss possible next steps in getting him a replacement machine. Reinforced  importance of OSA treatment and cardiac risks.     Aortic dilation:  Asymptomatic. Initially noted 1/2020 when aortic root measured 4.2cm and ascending aorta measured 4.0cm. On most recent limited echocardiogram 1/13/2022, aorta was not assessed. Last assessment was 1/2021 where root measured 4.3cm and ascending aorta measured 3.9cm, essentially stable from prior. Patient will be getting limited echo to follow up on LVEF in 3 months and will ask for re-assessment of aorta at this time to assess for progression. Reinforced importance of blood pressure control to prevent progression.     Hypertension - goal BP ~ 120-130/80s mmHg. Currently unclear control. Recent echo with blood pressure 140/80 (though patient reports walking 2.5 hours to get to his echo appointment, thus may have been a false elevation). Due to his complex social situation and currently living in his car, he has been unable to check his blood pressures understandably. In the last 10 days, has been adherent to all blood pressure therapies which include metop succinate 100mg/day, Valsartan 40mg/day. When able, patient will start checking blood pressures again and alert us if trending > 130/80,     Hyperlipidemia - LDL goal < 70 for secondary prevention of CAD. Lipid panel with LDL 88, HDL 80, TG 153. LDL above goal, however patient has been struggling with medication non-compliance in setting of alcohol use lately thus lipids do not reflect treatment on currently prescribed medications. Mildly elevated TGs also likely related to high ETOH consumption. Patient has been compliant with atorvastatin 80mg/day and ASA 81mg/day for the last 10 days. We will plan on ordering a repeat lipid panel at our follow up in 3 months to re-assess. If compliant with medications and LDL remains > 70, will consider addition of Zetia at  that time. Continue high intensity statin therapy and aspirin 81 mg lifelong.     Hemoglobin A1c/Prediabetes - Most recent HbA1c - 5.8%, above goal <5.6%. Focus now on alcohol cessation and will plan to repeat A1C at follow up visit.     Cardiovascular risk reduction - regular physical activity, along with dietary and lifestyle modification are imperative to mitigate the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Recommendations include optimizing blood pressure (with regular home BP monitoring), lipid profile and glycemic control, targeting goal values mentioned above. Additional general recommendations include adherence to a low fat, low sodium <2gms/day, heart healthy diet, and engaging in at least 150 mins per week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (always symptom-limited).    Homelessness, food insecurity and alcohol overuse: Currently these are patient's most pressing and urgent issues. For the last 3-4 months, he has been living in his truck and in occasional motels after apparently being asked to leave his sister's home due to his alcohol overuse. Patient relapsed with his alcohol use in setting of significant life stressors including his wife leaving him and his mother passing away. He has a supportive brother who has gone through AA and has been sober who has been helpful to him during this difficult time and he is thinking about going to AA himself. Currently is contemplative about alcohol cessation and open to residential treatment and has drastically decreased ETOH consumption to 2 beers/day. He is taking Naltrexone 50mg/day since hospital DC. Denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. Patient would very much like to speak with a social worker for assistance in finding an ETOH residential treatment program and in the interim, also help with housing and food resources. I placed an urgent referral today to social work and very much appreciate their assistance and care. He will also be  establishing with Dr Pillai in primary care next month and we encouraged him to please keep this visit.     We dicussed signs and symptoms which should prompt her to seek urgent care in the ED, patient amendable.     Recommendation Summary:   New medications to START    Medications to MODIFY    Medications to STOP    Diagnostic tests ordered Repeat echo in 3 months   Laboratory work ordered    Referral to - Social work   Additional recommendations - Please schedule follow up with Dr Nguyen (the electric heart doctor) as soon as you can.   - Send your sleep doctor (Dr. Kawai) a message over MyHealth letting him know your CPAP was stolen.   - The addiction medicine doctor you spoke with in the hospital recommended you call this number for further resources: San Mateo County Access line (650-802-6400)     Please follow up with me in clinic in 3 months       Stephanie Elizabeth Bruhnke, NP     A total of 40 minutes was spent as part of this shared visit, which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.    Physician Attestation     I performed a substantive portion of the visit face-to-face with the patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP) and participated in all aspects of the patient's evaluation and management. I discussed our clinical assessment and treatment plan with the patient and all questions were answered. I have reviewed the above note and agree with NP Stephanie Bruhnke's documented findings and plan of care, with edits made as needed. Please see my additional comments below.       55-year-old male with motor vehicle accident due to syncope in  1/2020, found to have newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy with LVEF 35%, regional WMA small flat troponin elevation, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate -thought to be related to demand ischemia and HF.  CTA with FFR which showed at least moderate three-vessel coronary artery disease, with more significant lesions in the LAD, however FFR 0.8. Patient subsequently underwent viability study which showed viable myocardium. Coronary angiography in 6/2019 with no significant CAD, however remains on aspirin and statin therapy for primary prevention of CAD.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with a probable significant component from heavy alcohol use, with LVEF recovery and subsequent decline who presents for cardiology follow up. Unfortunately since the last visit the patient had 2 recurrent hospitalizations due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of heavy alcohol use and medication noncompliance. Since his recent discharge in early January the patient does report compliance with his cardiac medications, but unfortunately also has multiple social stressors including lack of a social/family support and homelessness. As the patient's psychosocial situation is a significant barrier in his care and ability to maintain compliance with medications and abstain from alcohol, we will place a referral to social work to help address some of these barriers, the patient was amenable to proceeding with this. We discussed the importance of continuing cardiac medications and will not make any changes to his current regimen for now. Specifically we will hold off on adding spironolactone as this would require close laboratory monitoring and from a safety perspective we will prioritize the most important cardiac medications. We will plan to obtain a follow-up echocardiogram in 3 months to assess LV function, and the patient was encouraged to schedule a follow-up with the device  clinic/cardiac electrophysiology.

JaNahn Scalopino, Mark Mansour, Shirley Pang   Pain: Fralick  GI: Koo (Fullerton - St. Jude's)    ID/HPI: Lori Hantzis is a 64 Y female with HLA-B27 negative psoriatic arthritis, also w/ celiac disease    From today's video visit 2/23/2022  I contacted patient, verified correct individual, and ability to speak confidentially. Patient affirms they are in California at the time of visit.     I  have discussed the risks, benefits, and limitations of receiving care virtually with the patient. The patient expresses understanding and is willing to move forward.     -- Developed gradual onset of extremely sharp pain lumbar spine which moved toward L hip and progressively got worse - constant pressure exacerbated when she moved the wrong way  -- Could not sleep for more than 2 hrs every night for 3 mos.  PT made things worse, pushed her L hip rigorously which may have injured her.  -- Had gotten SI joint injection in 12/2021 - which didn't help too much, maybe took the edge off, but didn't last too long  -- Cosentyx has really helped w/ her sausage digits and knee, also thinks it has helped her back, hands, shoulders.  Cold weather makes things much worse but Cosentyx helps w/ break through flareups.   -- Pain currently 2-3/10 (with pain meds), pain went up to 7-8/10 when her SI joint was flaring.  Is confident that Cosentyx has helped her.   -- Having more hair loss w/ MTX - but folic acid 2 mg has helped mitigate some of the other side effects.  Does feel a bit sluggish on the day that she takes it.  -- Celiac disease: with gluten, develops abd discomfort, diarrhea, but also develops periarticular pain.    -- MEDS: Cosentyx, methotrexate, folic acid, lipitor, cymbalta, lisinopril, Norco, Ca/D, medrol PRN.    -- PtGA 60% (previously was 20%) - has 4 good hours a day    11/15/2021 VV  -- A few mos ago started having worsening issues w/ her pelvis, severe in the AM, needs to warm up, improves w/ movement. Got SI joint injection which did not help, SI joint films have been negative but hasn't had an MRI in a few years.  -- Has a job working as a yard duty assistant for 3 hrs -   -- Had to quit PT b/c it was making things worse  -- Consentyx really helped her compared w/ TNF inhibitors --> improved knee and back pain  -- Since last visit - started methotrexate.  Taking 15 mg a week (Q Wed) - mild nausea but is  tolerable, has not been splitting the dose.  Has helped her feel systemically  Better.    Video-> telephone visit 5/3/2021:  -- Is on pred 5 mg a day - which has made a big difference, has prevented further flares  -- With flares - gets diffuse full-body pain: ankles, neck, SI joints  -- Cosentyx helps but does not fully prevent flares.  Knee, fingers/toes have improved w/ Cosentyx. Has pain every day - goes to pain mgmt specialist.   -- Celiac disease: is now mostly completely gluten-free (since Jan - got endoscopy showing flattened villi).  Gets abd sxs including bloating when she consumes gluten  -- 2nd COVID shot 5/20/21    11/2/2020 VV:  -- Has gone off her pain meds --> thinks this has been exhausting given her pain.  Not sleeping well due to pain.  Has L leg weakness due to her back.  -- Increased her Cosentyx to a double dose - feels less nauseated w/ higher dose (?), is now only nauseated for 1 d (previously had nausea x 3-4 d after low dose Cosentyx).  Having some headaches. Feels like Cosentyx is helping her systemically and with her inflammatory joint pain, less stiffness.  Pain is primarily in her spine, shoulders, R knee (which Cosentyx has helped). No injection site reactions, no infections.    -- Took brief pulse of prednisone 5 mg x 5-7 d which helped her with her flare  -- Got a new primary doctor Dr. Swetha Mudunuri - is unable to get to a pain clinic locally.  Will go to El Dorado Hills for a pain clinic.  -- Will be seeing GI doctor for celiac - trying to avoid gluten but gluten-free foods are expensive and is dealing w/ food insecurity (applying for SNAP - supplemental nutritional assistance program).  Previously had Meals on Wheels but food was not healthy.    8/20/2020 VV  -- Moved up north toward Folsom  -- Cont to do well on Cosentyx for 3 wks then the last week she starts to flare - always her SI joints, across L-spine, previously felt like she was """"walking on rocks"""" which is much better  now.    -- Has new sharp pain in her R MTPs  -- Knee is so much better, fatigue is better  -- Gets nausea the day after Cosentyx  -- Stopped pain meds - no longer on norco  -- Current weight 145 -   -- Has not been completely gluten free - does note that gluten free does make her feel much better, less abd bloating    5/7/2020 VV:  -- Can now walk better since starting Cosentyx - this has been a game changer for her!  -- Significantly improved L shoulder, R knee, back pain/stiffness. Joint pain is currently 3/10 - was previously 6-9/10 prior to Cosentyx, especially her spine  -- Was able to go down on Norco  -- Still with fatigue which is her main complaint - some issues w/ insomnia.   -- Thinks Cosentyx has also helped her GI system. Thinks gluten just causes bloating but not other symptoms, has not been completely gluten free.    2/3/20:  -- B12 was low - getting a shot to replete  -- Had low sodium  -- Was found to have very high TTG Ab --> has stopped bread, and has lost several pounds with improvement in bloating symptoms.   -- Still with a lot of fatigue and joint pains.  -- Has a lot of pain in her back, neck, assoc w/ AM stiffness lasting for several hours -   -- Previously had significant improvement w/ Remicade x 10 yrs (life changing), then had a reaction to biosimilar Remicade, D/Cd 2016 - and has not been the same since then.    From initial visit 11/25/19:  As a child - had heaviness of her legs, was told these were """"growing pains"""".  Then had a series of gynecological surgeries (appendix out, tubal ligation, emergency hysterectomy).  Age 31, after emergency hysterectomy, is when she states that everything started - had issues w/ CTS B, neck pain, also w/ injuries (patellar fracture, vertebral fracture), several joint related issues. Was not dx'd with anything at that time.    Her spine has been a huge issue (neck --> lumbar).  Also R knee, L shoulder, MCPs and MTPs.      Early 1990s - was sent to a  rheumatologist for inflammatory joint pains. No improvement w/ plaquenil, then no improvement w/ Arava or Sulfasalazine.  Was started on remicade in mid 1990s. Remicade improved everything for her, including back, as well as peripheral joints.  Quality of life improved substantially.  Was initially on methotrexate (doesn't know dose) but had issues w/ canker sores.  Was working full time while on remicade, leading a very functional life.    Then 5 yrs ago Remicade lost its efficacy - started losing weight, losing hair, losing muscle tone.  Then went off of Remicade and her muscle tone came back.  Tried self injections of Humira which didn't help.  Recently had an infusion reaction to Simponi so this was D/C'd.  Has been on only steroids which really helps her knees.    Got bx for rashes on her legs that came back as """"lupus"""" but has been seronegative.    Currently is feeling very unwell - main complaint is that she is very fatigued.  Current joints that bother her are her SI joints, lumbar back pain, R knee. TMJ and neck are also bothering her.  No other peripheral joint manifestations.  AM stiffness lasting 2 hrs.  Pain is a major issue - mostly neck especially lower neck.  LBP with difficulty going up and down stairs.  Wears a knee brace.     Does not have known psoriasis.

The sacroiliac joints are not well seen, without obvious findings of ankylosis or erosions. However if there is clinical concern for sacroiliitis, then dedicated imaging would be warranted.    X-rays B hands 11/25/19     IMPRESSION:  Â   1.  No radiographic evidence of inflammatory arthropathy.    Assessment/Recommendations:  Lori Hantzis is a lovely 64 Y female with PsA, HLA-B27 neg, with celiac disease.  She has previously had a dramatic response to Remicade x many years however lost efficacy in the past 5 yrs. (NB: Is unable to tolerate methotrexate - severe oral ulcers, other side effects)    Responded to remicade for years, but did not have similar responses to Humira or Simponi (infusion reaction).      She has had a h/o possible compression fracture of her  thoracic spine - would be good to get more documentation, and she has also had a recent DXA at UC Davis (Stable).  Concerned that her celiac disease has contributed to her osteoporosis    Has had a significant response to Cosentyx with significant pain relief and further improvement with use of methotrexate.  Currently off prednisone    Plan:    # Psoriatic arthritis: Inadequately controlled, but significantly improved on Cosentyx and methotrexate. Fatigue has improved with Cosentyx.  Now w/better disease control w/ MTX  -- Cont Cosentyx dose 300 mg Q month --> will try switching to 150 mg Q 2 wks for more consistent PK/PD effects  -- Cont methotrexate at 15 mg a week and folic acid 2 mg a day -->splitting dose has mitigated some side effects  -- Folic acid 2 mg daily  -- Try biotin supplements for hair loss (but stop 24 hr prior to getting labs drawn to avoid intererence w/ lab assays)  -- Now off prednisone --> short steroid bursts as needed only for flare  -- Standing labs at LabCorp every 3 mos - pt to mark her calendar  -- No further PT at this point - suspect she may have sustained an injury to L hip that set off a flare  -- Agree w/ massage therapy     # Celiac disease: gets bloating w/ gluten. Fatigue could be related to celiac. Lactose intolerant.  -- Appreciate GI - has been dx w/ celiac disease  -- Recommend gluten avoidance - and close monitoring of symptoms - doing much better  -- vit D has been repleted  -- Will need B12 repletion and recommend Ca/D for osteoporosis which can be exacerbated by celiac    # Bone Health: DEXA -2.5 (2015), repeat stable per pt (2020) - results not available to me  -- Have asked pt to try to get copies of all her prior records- in particular would like to see her most recent DXA scan.  Has a h/o compression fractures (?) which should be treated.  Did not tolerate fosamax - would consider reclast.  -- DXA  stable- work with PMD on treatment of osteoporosis - could not  previously tolerate fosamax due to side effects  -- Was told by her PMD that she is stable since 5 yrs ago    # HCM:  -- Got flu shot 2020, got 1st COVID vaccine, 2nd shot 5/20/2021, has not yet gotten booster - educated to hold methotrexate for a week  -- HTN: Lisinopril 10 mg  -- HLD: atorvastatin  -- Pain mgmt --> rec'd referral from her PMD    Thank you for this interesting consultation. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any additional questions.  I will continue to follow this patient with you.    RTC 6 mos - in person    I personally spent a total of 40 minutes which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.

"116",116,4222,FALSE,"","Stanford Hospital and Clinics  Rheumatology Video Visit Note    Date: 2/23/2022     Consult performed at the request of provider:  Shirley Pang    PMD: Amy Alias, looking for a new PMD in Bay Area --> Swetha Mudunuri   Rheum: Drs. JaNahn Scalopino, Mark Mansour, Shirley Pang   Pain: Fralick  GI: Koo (Fullerton - St. Jude's)    ID/HPI: Lori Hantzis is a 64 Y female with HLA-B27 negative psoriatic arthritis, also w/ celiac disease    From today's video visit 2/23/2022  I contacted patient, verified correct individual, and ability to speak confidentially. Patient affirms they are in California at the time of visit.     I have discussed the risks, benefits, and limitations of receiving care virtually with the patient. The patient expresses understanding and is willing to move forward.     -- Developed gradual onset of extremely sharp pain lumbar spine which moved toward L hip and progressively got worse - constant pressure exacerbated when she moved the wrong way  -- Could not sleep for more than 2 hrs every night for 3 mos.  PT made things worse, pushed her L hip rigorously which may have injured her.  -- Had gotten SI joint injection in 12/2021 - which didn't help too much, maybe took the edge off, but didn't last too long  -- Cosentyx has really helped w/ her sausage digits and knee, also thinks it has helped her back, hands, shoulders.  Cold weather makes things much worse but Cosentyx helps w/ break through flareups.   -- Pain currently 2-3/10 (with pain meds), pain went up to 7-8/10 when her SI joint was flaring.  Is confident that Cosentyx has helped her.   -- Having more hair loss w/ MTX - but folic acid 2 mg has helped mitigate some of the other side effects.  Does feel a bit sluggish on the day that she takes it.  -- Celiac disease: with gluten, develops abd discomfort, diarrhea, but also develops periarticular pain.    -- MEDS: Cosentyx, methotrexate, folic acid, lipitor, cymbalta, lisinopril, Norco, Ca/D,  medrol PRN.    -- PtGA 60% (previously was 20%) - has 4 good hours a day    11/15/2021 VV  -- A few mos ago started having worsening issues w/ her pelvis, severe in the AM, needs to warm up, improves w/ movement. Got SI joint injection which did not help, SI joint films have been negative but hasn't had an MRI in a few years.  -- Has a job working as a yard duty assistant for 3 hrs -   -- Had to quit PT b/c it was making things worse  -- Consentyx really helped her compared w/ TNF inhibitors --> improved knee and back pain  -- Since last visit - started methotrexate.  Taking 15 mg a week (Q Wed) - mild nausea but is tolerable, has not been splitting the dose.  Has helped her feel systemically  Better.    Video-> telephone visit 5/3/2021:  -- Is on pred 5 mg a day - which has made a big difference, has prevented further flares  -- With flares - gets diffuse full-body pain: ankles, neck, SI joints  -- Cosentyx helps but does not fully prevent flares.  Knee, fingers/toes have improved w/ Cosentyx. Has pain every day - goes to pain mgmt specialist.   -- Celiac disease: is now mostly completely gluten-free (since Jan - got endoscopy showing flattened villi).  Gets abd sxs including bloating when she consumes gluten  -- 2nd COVID shot 5/20/21    11/2/2020 VV:  -- Has gone off her pain meds --> thinks this has been exhausting given her pain.  Not sleeping well due to pain.  Has L leg weakness due to her back.  -- Increased her Cosentyx to a double dose - feels less nauseated w/ higher dose (?), is now only nauseated for 1 d (previously had nausea x 3-4 d after low dose Cosentyx).  Having some headaches. Feels like Cosentyx is helping her systemically and with her inflammatory joint pain, less stiffness.  Pain is primarily in her spine, shoulders, R knee (which Cosentyx has helped). No injection site reactions, no infections.    -- Took brief pulse of prednisone 5 mg x 5-7 d which helped her with her flare  -- Got a new  primary doctor Dr. Swetha Mudunuri - is unable to get to a pain clinic locally.  Will go to El Dorado Hills for a pain clinic.  -- Will be seeing GI doctor for celiac - trying to avoid gluten but gluten-free foods are expensive and is dealing w/ food insecurity (applying for SNAP - supplemental nutritional assistance program).  Previously had Meals on Wheels but food was not healthy.    8/20/2020 VV  -- Moved up north toward Folsom  -- Cont to do well on Cosentyx for 3 wks then the last week she starts to flare - always her SI joints, across L-spine, previously felt like she was """"walking on rocks"""" which is much better now.    -- Has new sharp pain in her R MTPs  -- Knee is so much better, fatigue is better  -- Gets nausea the day after Cosentyx  -- Stopped pain meds - no longer on norco  -- Current weight 145 -   -- Has not been completely gluten free - does note that gluten free does make her feel much better, less abd bloating    5/7/2020 VV:  -- Can now walk better since starting Cosentyx - this has been a game changer for her!  -- Significantly improved L shoulder, R knee, back pain/stiffness. Joint pain is currently 3/10 - was previously 6-9/10 prior to Cosentyx, especially her spine  -- Was able to go down on Norco  -- Still with fatigue which is her main complaint - some issues w/ insomnia.   -- Thinks Cosentyx has also helped her GI system. Thinks gluten just causes bloating but not other symptoms, has not been completely gluten free.    2/3/20:  -- B12 was low - getting a shot to replete  -- Had low sodium  -- Was found to have very high TTG Ab --> has stopped bread, and has lost several pounds with improvement in bloating symptoms.   -- Still with a lot of fatigue and joint pains.  -- Has a lot of pain in her back, neck, assoc w/ AM stiffness lasting for several hours -   -- Previously had significant improvement w/ Remicade x 10 yrs (life changing), then had a reaction to biosimilar Remicade, D/Cd 2016 -  and has not been the same since then.    From initial visit 11/25/19:  As a child - had heaviness of her legs, was told these were """"growing pains"""".  Then had a series of gynecological surgeries (appendix out, tubal ligation, emergency hysterectomy).  Age 31, after emergency hysterectomy, is when she states that everything started - had issues w/ CTS B, neck pain, also w/ injuries (patellar fracture, vertebral fracture), several joint related issues. Was not dx'd with anything at that time.    Her spine has been a huge issue (neck --> lumbar).  Also R knee, L shoulder, MCPs and MTPs.      Early 1990s - was sent to a rheumatologist for inflammatory joint pains. No improvement w/ plaquenil, then no improvement w/ Arava or Sulfasalazine.  Was started on remicade in mid 1990s. Remicade improved everything for her, including back, as well as peripheral joints.  Quality of life improved substantially.  Was initially on methotrexate (doesn't know dose) but had issues w/ canker sores.  Was working full time while on remicade, leading a very functional life.    Then 5 yrs ago Remicade lost its efficacy - started losing weight, losing hair, losing muscle tone.  Then went off of Remicade and her muscle tone came back.  Tried self injections of Humira which didn't help.  Recently had an infusion reaction to Simponi so this was D/C'd.  Has been on only steroids which really helps her knees.    Got bx for rashes on her legs that came back as """"lupus"""" but has been seronegative.    Currently is feeling very unwell - main complaint is that she is very fatigued.  Current joints that bother her are her SI joints, lumbar back pain, R knee. TMJ and neck are also bothering her.  No other peripheral joint manifestations.  AM stiffness lasting 2 hrs.  Pain is a major issue - mostly neck especially lower neck.  LBP with difficulty going up and down stairs.  Wears a knee brace.     Does not have known psoriasis.

Assessment/Recommendations:  Lori Hantzis is a lovely 64 Y female with PsA, HLA-B27 neg, with celiac disease.  She has previously had a dramatic response to Remicade x many years however lost efficacy in the past 5 yrs. (NB: Is unable to tolerate methotrexate - severe oral ulcers, other side effects)    Responded to remicade for years, but did not have similar responses to Humira or Simponi (infusion reaction).      She has had a h/o possible compression fracture of her thoracic spine - would be good to get more documentation, and she has also had a recent DXA at UC Davis (Stable).  Concerned that her celiac disease has contributed to her osteoporosis    Has had a significant response to Cosentyx with significant pain relief and further improvement with use of methotrexate.  Currently off prednisone    Plan:    # Psoriatic arthritis: Inadequately controlled, but significantly improved on Cosentyx and methotrexate. Fatigue has improved with Cosentyx.  Now w/better disease control w/ MTX  -- Cont Cosentyx dose 300 mg Q month --> will try switching to 150 mg Q 2 wks for more consistent PK/PD effects  -- Cont methotrexate at 15 mg a week and folic acid 2 mg a day -->splitting dose has mitigated some side effects  -- Folic acid 2 mg daily  -- Try biotin supplements for hair loss (but stop 24 hr prior to getting labs drawn to avoid intererence w/ lab assays)  -- Now off prednisone --> short steroid bursts as needed only for flare  -- Standing labs at LabCorp every 3 mos - pt to mark her calendar  -- No further PT at this point - suspect she may have sustained an injury to L hip that set off a flare  -- Agree w/ massage therapy     # Celiac disease: gets bloating w/ gluten. Fatigue could be related to celiac. Lactose intolerant.  -- Appreciate GI - has been dx w/ celiac  disease  -- Recommend gluten avoidance - and close monitoring of symptoms - doing much better  -- vit D has been repleted  -- Will need B12 repletion and recommend Ca/D for osteoporosis which can be exacerbated by celiac    # Bone Health: DEXA -2.5 (2015), repeat stable per pt (2020) - results not available to me  -- Have asked pt to try to get copies of all her prior records- in particular would like to see her most recent DXA scan.  Has a h/o compression fractures (?) which should be treated.  Did not tolerate fosamax - would consider reclast.  -- DXA  stable- work with PMD on treatment of osteoporosis - could not previously tolerate fosamax due to side effects  -- Was told by her PMD that she is stable since 5 yrs ago    # HCM:  -- Got flu shot 2020, got 1st COVID vaccine, 2nd shot 5/20/2021, has not yet gotten booster - educated to hold methotrexate for a week  -- HTN: Lisinopril 10 mg  -- HLD: atorvastatin  -- Pain mgmt --> rec'd referral from her PMD    Thank you for this interesting consultation. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any additional questions.  I will continue to follow this patient with you.    RTC 6 mos - in person    I personally spent a total of 40 minutes which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.

Recent abdominal surgery in september.      SW was consulted to provide pt with resources to address her food insecurity. SW met with pt at b/s and introduced self and role within the care team. Pt explained that she lives in a homeless hotel for seniors and has access to a kitchenette but often struggles to afford food, especially food that is appropriate for her complex medical needs. Pt said that she recently completed an intake with Meals on Wheels but was told that, because she does not have mobility issues, she does not qualify for the service at this time. Pt explained that she is an avid cyclist and that she struggles to maintain her current bodyweight and strength due to her current food insecurity.    SW provided pt with a phone number for Health Plan of San Mateo where she can get connected with a complex care manager who can assist her in determining which type(s) of food aid she qualifies for. SW also provided pt with information for San Mateo Core Services and explained that, if the above resource is not helpful, she can go to any of the locations to get connected with a case manager.

As you know, Alejandro has a history of chromosomal disorder with a heterozyous 41kb deletion in 3p12.3 involving ROBO1 gene, global developmental delay, self injurious behavior, mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and hypotonia. There is concern for another as yet undiagnosed genetic disorder to explain the severity of his symptoms, such as Lesch Nyhan, although work up is in progress and this has not been diagnosed. There is also a prior diagnosis of Autism. At present, the most significant behavioral concerns include daily head hitting/scratching to the point that he is bleeding as well as difficulties with sleeping.    Alejandro has had a number of prior evaluations including by genetics at Valley Childrens, Neurology at both Valley Childrens and Stanford Children's, and a prior consult with Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics at Valley Childrens.  He is referred today for additional consultation for treatment options for self injury.    This was a team evaluation.  The participants were:  Â· Hanna Knihtila, M.D, Ph.D - Pediatrics Resident  Â· Sarah Dubner, M.D. - Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrician  Â· Cyril Rueca, MSN, RN, Clinical Coordinator      This assessment was conducted using secure and encrypted videoconferencing equipment and a trained telehealth presenter.  The potential risks and benefits of the telehealth session were discussed and verbal  consent to participate was obtained, and the visit was conducted with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter.       DEVELOPMENTAL & BEHAVIORAL HISTORY:  Alejandro has global developmental delay. He is not walking yet but sitting unsupported and crawling. Not talking apart from rarely saying mama or papa. Mostly sitting or lying on the bed at home during daytime. Appears to enjoy watching a specific cartoon and sometimes enjoys spending time backyard. Parents are unsure about his ability to hear with the hearing aid but he likes to have the cartoon on very loud. The family has had difficulties with Alejandro's feeding, his diet mainly consists of Pediasure with a bottle, recently started also eating Gerber purees (sweet ones such as apple), parents feed him with a spoon.    Alejandro has demonstrated worsening self injurious behavior for the past 6 months: hits his head to the point that he is bleeding continuously several times a day. The family is waiting for a medical helmet and currently using a football helmet.  They say two prior helmets have been provided, but they were the wrong ones.    Significant difficulties with sleeping: falls asleep after 8PM but stays asleep for only 4-5 hours a time before waking up banging his head and parents show him cartoons in order to calm him down. Usually stays awake until 5AM when falls asleep again for 4 hours or less. Was started on melatonin 1mg in 6/2021 without improvement. Changed to clonidine 0.1mg which helps him to fall asleep in 15-20 mins but does not help with staying asleep.    Current therapies include physical therapy.  There is someone that was coming to the house (? behaviorist), but family requested they stop because it was not helpful.   In addition to the helmet, SMOs have been recommended.    Early Milestones:  Parents report only that he """"cannot do anything"""", and cannot report any babbling or words that he may make.  They report that he does not yet  sit independently, however in the assessment today, that is observed.  They report that he can bear weight holding on to furniture, but we were unable to observe that today.      PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Alejandro was born prematurely at 36 weeks gestation by cesearean section after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Needed some respiratory support and stayed at the hospital 6 days after birth.  Alejandro has reportedly passed vision screen but has bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. His immunizations are up-to-date. Alejandro is allergic to penicillin, no other known allergies, no asthma.    Alejandro's exact clinical diagnosis is still unclear, but genetic testing on 9/4/2020 show a heterozygous mutation 41 kb on chromosome 3p12.3 (varian of uncertain significance) located within the ROBO1 gene maternally inherited and also a region of homozygosity >5Mb detected GRCh37 11q23.3-q24.2 (116439719_126443095). Fragile X testing was normal. Exome show homozygous for variant of uncertain significance of MPZL2p.P129R which was interpreted as pathologic as patient has hearing loss. Brain MRI without contrast on 3/19/21 normal. Comprehensive metabolic labwork on 11/30/21 show decreased guanidinoacetate/creatinine ration (16) suggesting possible arginine-glycine amidinotransferase  deficiency, and increased CK (212).     Alejandro is followed by:   Valley Medical Center Medical Genetics (Dr. Woods): last seen 11/30/21: """"The patients phenotype and/or genotype are consistent with likely autosomal recessive hearing loss with no definitive mendelian genetic cause for his neurodevelopmental disorder. I am extremely concerned for another genetic disorder such as a Lesch Nyhan that was missed by his exome sequencing. As such I will send a metabolic workup per below. Genome sequencing should be considered pending this workup. I will also send for pharmacogenomic testing as allopurinol can be used to treat Lesch Nyhan and has  pharmacogenomically relevant alleles.

ER visit x 1 for SIB.    FAMILY & SOCIAL HISTORY:  Alejandro lives with his  parents and little brother in Winton, also has 7 older half siblings.  Alejandro's siblings are developing normally. Mother is staying at home with Alejandro and his little brother (1 year old) and father also had to stop working recently to help mother due to Alejandro's worsening self injurious behavior and sleeping difficulties. Neither parent reports having had any learning or behavioral problems as a child.  By report from the medical record, there are concerns that the brother is exhibiting similar behavior.    The family history is negative for any identified learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Tourette's or other tic disorders, speech fluency disorders, birth defects, genetic syndromes or other significant mental illness.    Per outside records. VCH social work has helped the family with FMLA, PFL, connecting with Charlie Mitchell Clinic  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Alejandro has global developmental delay but no history of developmental regression or loss of milestones. There is no history of recurring fevers, cyclic vomiting, rashes, joint pains, chronic diarrhea, or difficulties with growth.  Per LPCH Neurology notes, there is a concern for a history of staring spells but no drop attacks, syncope, shaking, or seizures.      PRIOR TESTING & EVALUATIONS:  Alejandro has different services from Early Start and California Children's Services, including physical therapy, feeding therapy, and medical equipment (medical chair, hearing aid, waiting for a helmet). No reports available at today's visit.      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alejandro presents as a well-nourished child. Coarse facial features and an abrasion on middle of the forehead, no active bleeding. Front teeth missing. The quality of my video did not allow detailed skin examination. Parents had to wake him up for the visit today.  Appears upset after father  carries him in the living room and repeatedly banging his head on the high chair tray. Later calms down after parents distract him with a cartoon.  Eyes and ears appear to have normal setting and morphology.    Alejandro does not make eye contact or other attempts to interact with parents or the examiners. No words or other vocalization apart from undirected crying/yelling was observed during the appointment. Able to partially isolate a finger and tap on a phone with one finger. Well coordinated movements of all four extremities and good head suppport observed. Independently moves from lying supine to a sitting position and on his tummy after father places him on his back. Crawls forward to a phone placed in front of him. No standing on walking observed.  Alejandro swiped all objects presented to him off the high chair tray without looking at them, with the exception of the phone.  He was only intermittently consolable by his parents attempts to distract him with the cell phone.  They did not use other soothing strategies.   He did not calm enough during the visit to attempt to assess his social or communication skills.    The Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development, 3rd edition Gross Motor domain was also administered in a non-standard fashion based on observation and parent faciliated activities. The Gross Motor subdomain measures the developmental functioning of infants and young children between the ages of 1 and 42 months. The Gross Motor domain is used to assess quality of movement and perceptual motor integration, as well as the basic milestones of prehension and locomotion.  As with any developmental test, the results of this assessment are not intended to predict later academic achievement or learning. The Gross Motor Domain produces an age equivalence and a Scaled Score. The Scaled Score has an average score of 10, with an average range of 7-13.     alejandro's preformance on the BSID-III Gross Motor  Domain is consistent with an age equivalence of 8-9 months.  A scaled score was not generated as some of the items could not be administered.    He could not be engaged to participate in any other formal developmental assessment and was not consolable to demonstrate his typical range of gross motor or fine motor skills per parent report.    IMPRESSION / DISCUSSION:  Alejandro is a 2 year old boy from Winton here for behavioral concerns including self injurious behavior and sleeping difficulties.  His history is notable for chromosomal disorder with a heterozyous 41kb deletion in 3p12.3 involving ROBO1 gene but his exact clinical diagnosis remains unclear, global developmental delay, self injurious behavior, mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and hypotonia.   His examination is remarkable for dysregulation, global developmental delay and repeated self injurious behavior.  Based on the assessment today, he clearly meets the criteria for global developmental delay.      Behavior/SIB: We were unable to obtain an accurate assessment of cognitive functioning and thus is it not clear to me whether he would benefit from ABA based approaches to his SIB. At the same time, his parents would certainly benefit from building a trusting relationship with a behaviorist to best understand his cues and find additional distraction or soothing techniques for his very challenging behaviors. Dr. Johnson also suggested considering a daytime dose of clonidine, which I support.  Another option would be to switch from clonidine to guanfacine, which may help both with the sleep and with daytime impulsivity if daytime clonidine was not effective in reducing SIB.  For other pharmacological intervention, I would not consider Risperdal or Abilify or similar at least until after other daytime medication approaches were tried.     I explained to the parents that my first priority would be to follow up with genetics and complete  the work up that has been started.  If there is a second metabolic condition to explain his behaviors, it may be treatable with specific supplements, which may improve his behaviors and cognitive development.    Alejandro should certainly qualify for IHSS and his family would additionally benefit from nursing support in the home for his medical and safety needs.    Feeding: We did not address the feeding concerns today - they were discussed at the DBP visit several weeks ago and we agree with the recommendations for OT to treat feeding aversion and close monitoring of his weight trajectory.    Sleep: currently improvement in falling asleep with clonidine. Per Dr. Johnson's note, she recommended decreasing nighttime clonidine to 0.05 and giving a second dose of 0.05 as needed if he wakes in the night.  This was my thought as well.  Recommend discussing further with prescribing physician whether, in addition to good sleep hygeine, a second dose could be given for night time wakings. Melatonin was previously recommended by DBP and that may also be helpful for Alejandro    Alejandro's behavior is posing a significant risk to his safety and well being, as well as significant stress to the family requiring father to stop working. We had limited ability to examine the patient via Telehealth today and having multiple providers following the patient, we will plan to have the family send reports from the Regional Center and CCS, and we will contact Alejandro's other providers to verify his responses to his current therapies and pharmacotherapies and discuss any additional therapies that may be helpful.        RECOMMENDATIONS:  1. Discussed with Alejandro's parents about the importance of attending today's appointment at Valley Medical Center Medical Genetics. Knowing his exact clinical diagnosis might help to start targeted treatments and it would help with his long term treatment plan.    2. Instructed parents to send  Alejandro's Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) and therapy reports to help decide if he would benefit from additional services.     3. We will ask our social worker, Michelle Ma, to contact the father for assistance with IHSS, food insecurity, and any other available supports.    3. We will contact Alejandro's Neurology and DBP providers at Valley Medical Center to discuss about possible pharmacotherapeutic options for his behavioral symptoms.    4. Right now we will plan for Alejandro to come to Stanford for an in-person examination and developmental evaluation if this is covered by insurance.  Given the many consultations he has already had, we will contact his other consultants to determine the best plan for follow up.      It was a pleasure meeting Alejandro and his parents today. It is our hope the recommendations contained herein will be of benefit.

As you know, Alejandro has a history of chromosomal disorder with a heterozyous 41kb deletion in 3p12.3 involving ROBO1 gene, global developmental delay, self injurious behavior, mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and hypotonia. There is concern for another as yet undiagnosed genetic disorder to explain the severity of his symptoms, such as Lesch Nyhan, although work up is in progress and this has not been diagnosed. There is also a prior diagnosis of Autism. At present, the most significant behavioral concerns include daily head hitting/scratching to the point that he is bleeding as well as difficulties with sleeping.    Alejandro has had a number of prior evaluations including by genetics at Valley Childrens, Neurology at both Valley Childrens and Stanford Children's, and a prior consult with Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics at Valley Childrens.  He is referred today for additional consultation for treatment options for self injury.    This was a team evaluation.  The participants were:  Â· Hanna Knihtila, M.D, Ph.D - Pediatrics Resident  Â· Sarah Dubner, M.D. - Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrician  Â· Cyril Rueca, MSN, RN, Clinical Coordinator      This  assessment was conducted using secure and encrypted videoconferencing equipment and a trained telehealth presenter.  The potential risks and benefits of the telehealth session were discussed and verbal consent to participate was obtained, and the visit was conducted with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter.       DEVELOPMENTAL & BEHAVIORAL HISTORY:  Alejandro has global developmental delay. He is not walking yet but sitting unsupported and crawling. Not talking apart from rarely saying mama or papa. Mostly sitting or lying on the bed at home during daytime. Appears to enjoy watching a specific cartoon and sometimes enjoys spending time backyard. Parents are unsure about his ability to hear with the hearing aid but he likes to have the cartoon on very loud. The family has had difficulties with Alejandro's feeding, his diet mainly consists of Pediasure with a bottle, recently started also eating Gerber purees (sweet ones such as apple), parents feed him with a spoon.    Alejandro has demonstrated worsening self injurious behavior for the past 6 months: hits his head to the point that he is bleeding continuously several times a day. The family is waiting for a medical helmet and currently using a football helmet.  They say two prior helmets have been provided, but they were the wrong ones.    Significant difficulties with sleeping: falls asleep after 8PM but stays asleep for only 4-5 hours a time before waking up banging his head and parents show him cartoons in order to calm him down. Usually stays awake until 5AM when falls asleep again for 4 hours or less. Was started on melatonin 1mg in 6/2021 without improvement. Changed to clonidine 0.1mg which helps him to fall asleep in 15-20 mins but does not help with staying asleep.    Current therapies include physical therapy.  There is someone that was coming to the house (? behaviorist), but family requested they stop because it was not helpful.   In addition to the  helmet, SMOs have been recommended.    Early Milestones:  Parents report only that he """"cannot do anything"""", and cannot report any babbling or words that he may make.  They report that he does not yet sit independently, however in the assessment today, that is observed.  They report that he can bear weight holding on to furniture, but we were unable to observe that today.      PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Alejandro was born prematurely at 36 weeks gestation by cesearean section after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Needed some respiratory support and stayed at the hospital 6 days after birth.  Alejandro has reportedly passed vision screen but has bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. His immunizations are up-to-date. Alejandro is allergic to penicillin, no other known allergies, no asthma.    Alejandro's exact clinical diagnosis is still unclear, but genetic testing on 9/4/2020 show a heterozygous mutation 41 kb on chromosome 3p12.3 (varian of uncertain significance) located within the ROBO1 gene maternally inherited and also a region of homozygosity >5Mb detected GRCh37 11q23.3-q24.2 (116439719_126443095). Fragile X testing was normal. Exome show homozygous for variant of uncertain significance of MPZL2p.P129R which was interpreted as pathologic as patient has hearing loss. Brain MRI without contrast on 3/19/21 normal. Comprehensive metabolic labwork on 11/30/21 show decreased guanidinoacetate/creatinine ration (16) suggesting possible arginine-glycine amidinotransferase  deficiency, and increased CK (212).     Alejandro is followed by:   Valley Medical Center Medical Genetics (Dr. Woods): last seen 11/30/21: """"The patients phenotype and/or genotype are consistent with likely autosomal recessive hearing loss with no definitive mendelian genetic cause for his neurodevelopmental disorder. I am extremely concerned for another genetic disorder such as a Lesch Nyhan that was missed by his exome sequencing. As such I will send a  metabolic workup per below. Genome sequencing should be considered pending this workup. I will also send for pharmacogenomic testing as allopurinol can be used to treat Lesch Nyhan and has pharmacogenomically relevant alleles.

ER visit x 1 for SIB.    FAMILY & SOCIAL HISTORY:  Alejandro lives with his parents and little brother in Winton, also has 7 older half siblings.  Alejandro's siblings are developing normally. Mother is staying at home with Alejandro and his little brother (1 year old) and father also had to stop working recently to help mother due to Alejandro's worsening self injurious behavior and sleeping difficulties. Neither parent reports having had any learning or behavioral problems as a child.  By report from the medical record, there are concerns that the brother is exhibiting similar behavior.    The family history is negative for any identified learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Tourette's or other tic disorders, speech fluency disorders, birth defects, genetic syndromes or other significant mental illness.    Per outside records. VCH social work has helped the family with FMLA, PFL, connecting with Charlie Mitchell Clinic  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Alejandro has global developmental delay but no history of developmental regression or loss of milestones. There is no history of recurring fevers, cyclic vomiting, rashes, joint pains, chronic diarrhea, or difficulties with growth.  Per LPCH Neurology notes, there is a concern for a history of staring spells but no drop attacks, syncope, shaking, or seizures.      PRIOR TESTING & EVALUATIONS:  Alejandro has different services from Early Start and California Children's Services, including physical therapy, feeding therapy, and medical equipment (medical chair, hearing aid, waiting for a helmet). No reports available at today's visit.      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Alejandro presents as a well-nourished child. Coarse facial features and an abrasion on middle of the  forehead, no active bleeding. Front teeth missing. The quality of my video did not allow detailed skin examination. Parents had to wake him up for the visit today.  Appears upset after father carries him in the living room and repeatedly banging his head on the high chair tray. Later calms down after parents distract him with a cartoon.  Eyes and ears appear to have normal setting and morphology.    Alejandro does not make eye contact or other attempts to interact with parents or the examiners. No words or other vocalization apart from undirected crying/yelling was observed during the appointment. Able to partially isolate a finger and tap on a phone with one finger. Well coordinated movements of all four extremities and good head suppport observed. Independently moves from lying supine to a sitting position and on his tummy after father places him on his back. Crawls forward to a phone placed in front of him. No standing on walking observed.  Alejandro swiped all objects presented to him off the high chair tray without looking at them, with the exception of the phone.  He was only intermittently consolable by his parents attempts to distract him with the cell phone.  They did not use other soothing strategies.   He did not calm enough during the visit to attempt to assess his social or communication skills.    The Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development, 3rd edition Gross Motor domain was also administered in a non-standard fashion based on observation and parent faciliated activities. The Gross Motor subdomain measures the developmental functioning of infants and young children between the ages of 1 and 42 months. The Gross Motor domain is used to assess quality of movement and perceptual motor integration, as well as the basic milestones of prehension and locomotion.  As with any developmental test, the results of this assessment are not intended to predict later academic achievement or learning. The Gross  Motor Domain produces an age equivalence and a Scaled Score. The Scaled Score has an average score of 10, with an average range of 7-13.     alejandro's preformance on the BSID-III Gross Motor Domain is consistent with an age equivalence of 8-9 months.  A scaled score was not generated as some of the items could not be administered.    He could not be engaged to participate in any other formal developmental assessment and was not consolable to demonstrate his typical range of gross motor or fine motor skills per parent report.    IMPRESSION / DISCUSSION:  Alejandro is a 2 year old boy from Winton here for behavioral concerns including self injurious behavior and sleeping difficulties.  His history is notable for chromosomal disorder with a heterozyous 41kb deletion in 3p12.3 involving ROBO1 gene but his exact clinical diagnosis remains unclear, global developmental delay, self injurious behavior, mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and hypotonia.   His examination is remarkable for dysregulation, global developmental delay and repeated self injurious behavior.  Based on the assessment today, he clearly meets the criteria for global developmental delay.      Behavior/SIB: We were unable to obtain an accurate assessment of cognitive functioning and thus is it not clear to me whether he would benefit from ABA based approaches to his SIB. At the same time, his parents would certainly benefit from building a trusting relationship with a behaviorist to best understand his cues and find additional distraction or soothing techniques for his very challenging behaviors. Dr. Johnson also suggested considering a daytime dose of clonidine, which I support.  Another option would be to switch from clonidine to guanfacine, which may help both with the sleep and with daytime impulsivity if daytime clonidine was not effective in reducing SIB.  For other pharmacological intervention, I would not consider Risperdal  or Abilify or similar at least until after other daytime medication approaches were tried.     I explained to the parents that my first priority would be to follow up with genetics and complete the work up that has been started.  If there is a second metabolic condition to explain his behaviors, it may be treatable with specific supplements, which may improve his behaviors and cognitive development.    Alejandro should certainly qualify for IHSS and his family would additionally benefit from nursing support in the home for his medical and safety needs.    Feeding: We did not address the feeding concerns today - they were discussed at the DBP visit several weeks ago and we agree with the recommendations for OT to treat feeding aversion and close monitoring of his weight trajectory.    Sleep: currently improvement in falling asleep with clonidine. Per Dr. Johnson's note, she recommended decreasing nighttime clonidine to 0.05 and giving a second dose of 0.05 as needed if he wakes in the night.  This was my thought as well.  Recommend discussing further with prescribing physician whether, in addition to good sleep hygeine, a second dose could be given for night time wakings. Melatonin was previously recommended by DBP and that may also be helpful for Alejandro    Alejandro's behavior is posing a significant risk to his safety and well being, as well as significant stress to the family requiring father to stop working. We had limited ability to examine the patient via Telehealth today and having multiple providers following the patient, we will plan to have the family send reports from the Regional Center and CCS, and we will contact Alejandro's other providers to verify his responses to his current therapies and pharmacotherapies and discuss any additional therapies that may be helpful.        RECOMMENDATIONS:  1. Discussed with Alejandro's parents about the importance of attending today's appointment at Valley Medical  Center Medical Genetics. Knowing his exact clinical diagnosis might help to start targeted treatments and it would help with his long term treatment plan.    2.

We do not have any recent growth parameters and cannot comment on her growth trajectory.      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:  Vianey was happy, and she interacted with her mother and father.  She explored toys and objects around the room.  General:  No distress (e.g. work of breathing, crying),  activity normal  Skin:  No obvious skin lesions in uncovered skin  Head:  Normocephalic  Eyes:  Intact extraocular movements, no observable eye deviation or nystagmus  Nose:  No nasal discharge  Neck:  Full range of motion as initiated by patient  Chest/Lungs:  Unlabored breathing  Cardiac:  No observable cyanosis  Extremities: Symmetric use of extremities  Neuro: She appeared to have a mild decrease in axial tone. No observable increase/decrease in appendicular tone        DEVELOPMENTAL ASSESSMENT:  We used observation and parental report to apply and adapt items of the Capute Scales today.  This developmental measure is comprised of two scales, the Clinical Linguistic & Auditory Milestone Scale (CLAMS) and Cognitive  Adaptive Test (CAT). The Capute Scales assess the visual, motor, cognition and language streams of development from birth to 36 months of age. The developmental quotient (DQ) is calculated from the age equivalent at which a child is functioning in a stream of development divided by the chronological age (or adjusted age). A child is developing typically if the DQs in both the CAT and CLAMS are 86 and higher. A DQ between 75 and 85 represent borderline delays. Scores 70 or lower indicate significant delays in development. The scores on today's assessment should not be used as a predictor of later academic achievement or potential.    Based on parent report and observation Vianey's language skills appear to be consistent with an age equivalence of 12.5 months, a chronological DQ of 93 , an adjusted age DQ of 103.  This is in the normal range for adjusted age. Basal level is 11 months with additional points for following one-step command with gesture and producing immature jargoning.    Based on parent report and observation Vianey's visual motor/early cognitive skills appear to be consistent with about a 12 month age equivalence, a chronological DQ of 89, an adjusted DQ of 99.  This is in the normal range for adjusted age.  Basal level is 12 months.    Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition:   We used observation and parent report to apply the items of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 3rd Edition (BSID-III) Gross Motor Domain. The BSID-III assesses developmental functioning for children 1- 42 months of age. The results of this evaluation should not be used as a predictor of later academic achievement or intelligence.    Vianey's skills appear to be consistent with a raw score of 34,  age equivalence of 9 months.  This is in the borderline range for adjusted age. She crawled fluently.  She did not pull to stand but her parents report that she has started to do this.    OTHER ASSESSMENTS:  Our social worker, Melissa Herceg MSW, Clinical Social Worker met with the family and provided psychosocial assessment and support. Please see note in the electronic record for details.       IMPRESSIONS: In summary, Vianey is now 13 month(s) 11 day(s) and 12 month(s) 3 day(s) when adjusted for gestational age, Gestational Age: 34w3d.Her high risk factors include hypoglycemia requiring IV fluids >48 hrs.  We do not have any recent growth parameters and therefore cannot comment on recent weight gain or growth.  Vianey appeared on the smaller size for age.  The family reported that she had her last WCC on 12/29/21 and the pediatrician did not express any concern other than her anemia.  We did not notice significant physical or neurological findings via Telehealth. Developmental assessment through telehealth is limited and should be interpreted with caution.    Based on observation and parental report, she is demonstrating language and early cognitive/visual-motor skills consistent with her adjusted  age.  She demonstrated gross motor skills that were in the borderline range for age. There are no specific concerns about social-emotional development today and we observed Vianey interacting with her parents and copying actions that they demonstrated.      RECOMMENDATIONS:     Evaluation and Medical Care  - Vianey should continue to follow up with routine and subspecialty pediatric appointments as scheduled.    - Given her history of NICU care, we recommend that she be seen by Audiology by three years of age.       Additional Services  No new therapeutic services are indicated at this time.      Parent Support  - Anticipatory guidance regarding motor, language, cognitive and social-emotional development was discussed. We will send handouts that provide suggestions for good ways to foster these areas of development to the family.      Follow-up  - Given her high risk infant factors, Vianey needs continued close monitoring.  We would like to have her return to HRIF Clinic in approximately 10 months. At that time, we will reassess her developmental progress and needs. The family expressed a preference for a visit in-person if feasible.      It was a pleasure to see Vianey and her family today in our clinic.

The last visit in Neurology was on  5-2021      Interval History:   She has trouble sleeping, wakes up frequently overnight, but now maybe down to once per week. Mom has been giving her melatonin 20 mg at bedtime. Difficulty going to bed, will need melatonin, at around 8:30 then goes to bed at 9 or 9:30 pm or even 10 pm. Then wakes at 4 am and will miss school when this happens.  Does not go back to sleep during the day.   Slightly better with her behaviors but still problematic, if she does not want to go for a walk or participate in an activity will hit others. She will want to eat a great deal, mom tries to restrict her food intake but this is not easy for mom to keep her form over eating.  Likes to snack on a variety of foods.     She hasn't seen any events that look like seizure but still wakes up overnight once per week. She then might stay awake the rest of the night. Sometimes she might take a nap in between. She sleeps < 8 hours overnight most nights.     History of some aggression with the staff, hitting them since school started back.  Had a bad cluster over a day or two but overall spread out.  Mom is not sure what brought this on but change is a problem.  She recently started menstruating about 7-8 months ago. Transitioned from junior high to high school. Mother feels like the school is recommending that she talk  with her about behavior but the school is very short staffed so not able to assist with her behavior. Her brother works with kids that have autism as his job, mom will get some help from him. She is not getting any behavior therapy. She shares and aide with the class.  She will focus on a few fun things a puzzle or a book but short.  She sits by the door at school and not engage with activities. Will ask to leave over and over. She built a better relationship with her middle school teacher less so with the current teacher.  Mostly good with his parents, but will lash out at her 7 year old brother. More aggressive and irritable during her period, wants to be left alone during her period. Will also have a tantrums at school. Refusing to let them change her pads.    Mom continues to have trouble accessing behavioral therapy services for Isabela. Her contact at SARC is Marina Figueroa 408-374-9960      Review of Systems:    A complete 14-point review of systems is negative, except as noted in the HPI.     Medications:    Current Outpatient Medications   Medication Sig   â€¢ LORazepam (ATIVAN) 2 mg tablet Take 1 tablet (2 mg) by mouth once as needed (Place in cheek for seizure > 5 minutes or > 3 seizures in 1 hour).   â€¢ melatonin 1 mg Tablet tablet Take by mouth at bedtime.Gummies   â€¢ PV W-O CAL/FERROUS FUMARATE/FA (M-VIT ORAL) Take by mouth.       Allergies:   Latex, natural rubber    Past History:    Birth History:   - former ex-36 weeker born via SVD  -- mom maintained RA therapy (anti-inflammatories, and tramadol) throughout pregnancy  -- neonatal hyperbilirubinemia  Â   Past Medical History:   - deformational plagiocephaly  - constipation (uses OTC stool softener)  - localization related epilepsy  - severe intellectual disability  - spastic quadriparetic cerebral palsy   - Diminished capacity    Past Surgical History: umbilical and inguinal hernia repair (5 surgeries total)    Family History: Mom's sister with seizures  as an adult. There is otherwise no family history of developmental delay, learning problems, seizures, brain tumors, or other neurologic disorders.   Â   Social History:   -- lives at home with mom, siblings (two teens, one younger)  -- currently at Leyva Middle School  -- family reported food insecurity at prior visit, but that there is some additional income with son working and they are doing ok for now        PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:    Vital Signs:  There were no vitals taken for this visit.   Visual Physical Exam:  There were no vitals taken for this visit and the physical exam is minimal due to the nature of the telehealth visit.    General Appearance:  Alert, awake, in no apparent distress  Neurologic Exam:    Mental Status:   Alert, awake. Isabela smiles and waves at the camera.   Speech: She is nonverbal but vocalizes.  Cranial Nerves:     Motor: Moves upper limbs symmetrically.    Coordination:  Not able to test  Gait: She walked onto camera briefly and then left. Exam was limited but gait was steady.     Data: No interval labs or imaging for review     ASSESSMENT:   Isabela Martinez is a 14 yo female with spastic quadriparetic cerebral palsy, localization-related epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, aggression and self injurious behaviors.     Isabela's behavioral issues continue to affect her ability to access healthcare, addition to causing stress at home.     Â· Lack of sleep at night, then more behavior issues during the day. Trouble going to sleep and staying asleep at night this impacts her day.  Â· She is also aggressive with caregivers and her self on occasion, mostly related to her not getting what she wants from the visit.   Â· She is also eating more than she should, grazing during the day and evening.   Â· Mom is not sending her to school when she is having her period, she is often more upset during those times.   The primary encounter diagnosis was Localz-rltd symptomatic epilepsy w cmplx part  sz, notintrac, wo status. Diagnoses of Other insomnia and Anxiety were also pertinent to this visit.

Sleep issues are significant and not allowing her to function at school will add some atarax at bedtime or early in the morning when she wakes up.  It also can help with some of her anxiety. Went over that this is fast acting and should not cause to much issue with daytime sedation.  Though can use a lower dose 1/2 pill if needed.   2. Trying to help with her overall anxiety and the low dose SSRI might be helpful with this.  lexapro is commonly used for kids with behavior issues.  Will start with low dose to see how she does with this for her behavior.  Mother is reluctant to start the medication at this time would like to read more about this medication.  3. We recommend reaching back out to SARC and HOPE.  The school should redo a behavioral analysis plan.   4. Seizure rescue medication: For seizure > 3 minutes, Ativan 2 mg buccal  5. Successful dental procedure accomplished with sedation, this is a good model of trying the atarax for sedation to help with completing activities.    6. Discussed with her mother seeing Dr. Hillard for possible evaluation of period suppression.       No orders of the defined types were placed in this encounter.    Follow-up visit in three months, or sooner as needed should symptoms worsen or fail to respond to treatment plan as outlined.   Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or concerns at 650-723-0993.     I personally spent a total of 80 minutes managing the patient's condition on the date of  service, which includes face-to-face and non-face-to-face time, including: preparing to see the patient, obtaining history from the patient and/or guardian, performing a medically appropriate examination/evaluation, and counseling and educating the patient/family/caregiver ordering medications/tests/or procedures referring to and/or communicating with other healthcare professionals coordinating care.    *Brenda Elaine Porter, MD, PhD 1/19/2022 14:47"

For each statement, please tell me whether the statement was often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months.    1. â€œWe worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.â€ sometimes true   2. â€œThe food we bought just didnâ€™t last, and we didnâ€™t have money to get more.â€ often true  3. If true in Q#1 or Q#2, did this worry start or worsen due  to COVID pandemic/shelter in place? Yes    If often true, sometimes true in questions #1 and #2, then   We would like more information on free or affordable food resources in the area:  Yes  We would like to speak to a Social Worker: No      Physical Examination:  i  Vital Signs:  Ht 127.5 cm (4' 2.2"""")  | Wt (!) 45.5 kg  | HC 54.5 cm (21.46"""")  | BMI 27.99 kg/mÂ²   Gen: Well-appearing, no acute distress. Laughing and playful with mother. Giving mother and younger brother hugs.  HEENT: Normocephalic, Sclera and conjunctiva clear, Moist mucous membranes  CV: Extremities are warm and well perfused.  Pulm: Comfortable work of breathing. No respiratory distress.   Abdo: soft, non-tender, non-distended. +protuberant.    NEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Mental Status: Awake, alert. Non-verbal. Not consistently following commands.   Cranial Nerves: PERRL. EOMI with conjugate gaze. No ptosis or nystagmus. Symmetrical facial movements. Tongue protrudes midline.   Motor: Normal muscle bulk and appropriate tone throughout.  No extraneous movements.  No obvious focal deficits of strength.  Sensory:  Intact and symmetric to light touch throughout.  Deep Tendon Reflexes: 2+ at bilateral brachioradialis, biceps, patella.  No clonus.   Coordination: No dysmetria when reaching for toys.  Gait: Normal station and stride    Observed episodes of laughter, during which patient was happy, smiling and playful with mother, and responsive to mother asking him to stop.     I have reviewed the following reports and have reviewed the imaging studies, and agree with the findings outline below.   Labs:  No recent labs    Imaging:    No brain MRI results, past 365d.    EEG:  EEG Routine (Report date: 12/17/2021)  INTERPRETATION:   This EEG is normal for age, without evidence of focality or epileptiform activity.   Â   Comments:    Absence of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or seizures. No sleep  captured  Note this recording contained abundant movement artifact which limits interpretation.   Â   Review of Outside Records: Reviewed referral paperwork    ASSESSMENT:  Esmen is a 8-year old male with autism (non-verbal) who presents for evaluation of episodes of laughter.     During examination, we observed episodes of laughter during which patient was interactive with environment and happy appearing. Mother noted that episodes of interest were similar to these witnessed episodes. Routine EEG was normal.    Esmen's episodes of laughter are unlikely to be epileptic (eg gelastic seizures) given the presence of mirth with laughter, responsiveness during the episodes, and absence of post-ictal state despite prolonged duration of the episodes. The episodes of laughter and subsequent episodes of crying could be due to difference in communication given Esmen's communication. We spoke extensively about how autistic children communicate differently than other children, especially those that are non-verbal. At this time, we do not recommend additional EEG or neuroimaging.     The primary encounter diagnosis was Autism spectrum disorder with accompanying language impairment and intellectual disability, requiring support. Diagnoses of Behavior concern and Food insecurity were also pertinent to this visit.    Patient Active Problem List    Diagnosis Date Noted   â€¢ Autism spectrum disorder with accompanying language impairment and intellectual disability, requiring support 08/09/2018   â€¢ Effusion of hip joint, right 08/09/2018   â€¢ Transient synovitis of right hip 08/09/2018       PLAN / RECOMMENDATIONS:   1. No neuroimaging indicated at this time   2. Provided resources on food insecurity  3. Follow up as needed   - patient should return to clinic if episodes are associated with mirthless laughter or eerie laughter, if episodes are associated with abnormal, rhythmic movements of extremities or unresponsiveness    QI: Seizures  Precautions and First-Aid Discussed with Patient/Family?

Cranial Nerves:   EOM appear to be full and conjugate. No nystagmus.  Face is symmetric. Opens and closes eyes symmetrically.  Hearing intact. Shoulder shrug symmetric. Tongue protrudes in midline.   Motor: Moves upper limbs symmetrically. No appearance of tremor, dystonia or spasticity. No pronator drift.   Coordination:  Finger-to-nose normal bilaterally. RAM normal bilaterally.   Gait: Normal casual gait. He could hop on one foot at least 1-2 times.          Data:  Fast MRI brain 12/13/2020  There is mild nonspecific enlargement of the supratentorial ventricles, with asymmetric prominence of the left lateral ventricle..  There is no midline shift or brain herniation.  There is no large extra-axial collections.   Thickened right parietal calvarium, likely related to healed remote cephalohematoma.  IMPRESSION:  1.  Mild nonspecific enlargement of the supratentorial ventricles.  2.  Please note that these limited MR sequences cannot accurately assess for small extra-axial collections, parenchymal or bony abnormalities.     Fragile X 12/18/20: 29 CGG repeats (plus or minus one repeat).     ASSESSMENT:   Enrique Rocha Camarillo is a 5 yo male with expressive speech delay and autism spectrum disorder. He has a history of a cephalohematoma, which is an extracranial hematoma and would not be expected to cause developmental delays. Fast MRI brain shows a thickened right parietal calvarium  likely related to the cephalohematoma. There is some mild prominence of the ventricles which can be a non-specific indicator of cerebral underdevelopment and is a common finding in children with developmental delay, but not specific to etiology. Fragile X testing was negative. His mother is interested in additional genetic work up for autism spectrum disorder; CGH was denied by insurance but he is following with genetics team to follow this.     He is making great progress with his speech and social interactions with speech therapy and ABA therapy.     Enrique's OFC is at ~98%ile based on prior measurements. This is largely tracking and there has not been any sudden jump in OFC percentiles. He does not have any features of increased intracranial pressure. His macrocephaly is favored to be benign.     The primary encounter diagnosis was Autism spectrum disorder. Diagnoses of Expressive speech delay and Macrocephaly were also pertinent to this visit.

Clinic Visit Date: 2/15/2022   I saw Ryland Wong Ramis 5-year old male on 2/15/2022 in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford for a follow-up visit. The patient was accompanied to this visit by his parents and two triplet brothers. The appointment was conducted in English.    Ryland was last seen in GI clinic 11/19/2021 and at that visit he had a history of being a triplet born preematurely (30 weeks 4 days), respiratory distress syndrome, 2 vessel cord, hypothyroidism, left sided kidney duplication, ROP, anemia of prematurity, GERD, recurrent vomiting, oral aversion, and poor growth requiring a gastrostomy tube for adequate hydration and nutrition.   GERD, vomiting mostly resolved - still quite sensitive to motion after bolus feeds and volume sensitive.  Constipation under good control with miralax daily and formula with added fiber.  Making good progress with PO feeds - on a break from OT feeding therapy. Willing to try all foods, working on increasing volume.  Good interval weight gain since the last visit with weight today at the 25%ile and BMI at the 64%ile; he appears well nourished on exam. Now receiving majority of calories overnight via g-tube per parental preference, advised to cut calories slightly to promote hunger for solid foods. Seen with dietician Sujata Anantharaman, RD.   Recommendations:   1) Continue 1/2 capful miralax per day  2) NEW feeding plan:  Decrease feeds by ~10%  New recipe for overnight feeds:    Mix 4 cans Pediasure 1.5 WITH fiber + 160mL water  Each boy gets 350mL of above mixture + 2 extra cans Pediasure 1.5 WITH Fiber (one day and one at night)  Add extra 50mL water flush each day in addition to water already given  3) Continue to work on  oral feeds - let Kelly know if you want a referral to feeding therapy  4) Return to clinic in 3 months.

The last visit in Neurology was on 10/28/2021; the last visit with me was on 10/28/2021.     Interval History:   Bao is a 14yo with septo optic dysplasia. He is followed in neurology for developmental delay and spasticity of his LE > UE.    Last seen in clinic on 11/11/2021. At that time plan was to refer to CCS, MRI brain and spine.    Since our last visit dad reports that he has been evaluated by CCS.  He now receives physical therapy once a week and speech therapy once a week.  He also underwent MRI of brain and spine, results below but significant for absence of septum pellucidum, borderline hypoplasia of optic nerves, and overall normal examination of spine.    Of note evaluation today is significant for weight loss of approximately 10 pounds in the past 5 months.  Dad reports that he feels bowel has been eating normally, 2-3 meals a day.  He has not noticed any ill fitting clothes.  Dad denies B symptoms including night sweats, easy bruising, easy bleeding.  Dad does note that bowel gets bloody noses, but states he has gotten these since he was little.  Bloody noses last approximately 1 to 2 minutes very rarely up to 10 minutes.  Dad does endorse that he feels Bao is """"lazy"""" about eating.  As below dad denies any food insecurity.    2 Question Screening Tool for Food Insecurity:  Iâ€™m going to read you two statements that people have made about their food situation. For each statement, please tell me whether the statement was often true, sometimes true, or never true for your  household in the last 12 months.    1. â€œWe worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.â€ never true   2. â€œThe food we bought just didnâ€™t last, and we didnâ€™t have money to get more.â€ never true  3. If true in Q#1 or Q#2, did this worry start or worsen due to COVID pandemic/shelter in place?

Chromosome karyotype: normal male  2. Chromosome microarray: normal male  3. Fragile XÂ negative/normalÂ with 28 CGG repeats  4. Long chain fatty acids: normal  5. Urinalysis: normal  Â   RESULTS of genetic testing performed 8/16/2015 at SCVMC:   6. Connexin 26 sequencing: Negative. Patient is a carrier for one copy of a mutation, transition G >Â A at nucleotide position 109, codon 37, amino acid change Valine >Â IsoLeucine. This mutation is disease causing only when another disease-causing mutation is also present in the other copy of this gene; making the inheritance pattern autosomal recessive. Carriers are typically not symptomatic, therefore this is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's hearing loss.   Â   2. Connexin 30 sequencing: Negative  Â   3.

Please correlate clinically.  The authenticating radiologist has reviewed the images and agrees with  the findings unless otherwise noted in the report.  END OF ADDENDUM  Â   BODY OF REPORT: COMPARISON: Â None.  TECHNIQUE:  MR images of the head were obtained.  Sagittal T1-weighted. Axial T1-weighted. Axial FLAIR. Axial FSE  T2-weighted. Axial diffusion-weighted. Axial gradient-echo.  Post-processed ADC map.  FINDINGS:  Brain: There is absence of the septum pellucidum. The pituitary gland  appears normal. The posterior pituitary bright spot is also normally  located. The articularis are not  particularly hypoplastic. The corpus  callosum is normally developed.  Incidental magna cisterna magna is seen.  Mild periventricular white matter signal is seen in especially in the  posterior regions of the brain, nonspecific. The lateral ventricles are  diffusely prominent which may be sequela of reduced overall white matter  volume rather than hydrocephalus. The third and fourth ventricles are not  particularly dilated.  No intracranial hemorrhage. No acute infarction. No restricted diffusion.  Myelination: Normal for age.  Gray-white matter differentiation: Normal.  Extra-axial fluid collections: None.  Paranasal sinuses: Visualized portions clear.  Mastoid air cells: Visualized portions clear.  CONCLUSION: Absence of the septum pellucidum is seen. This may be sequela  of septo-optic dysplasia, clinical correlation is recommended.  Prominent lateral ventricles may be sequela of reduced overall white  matter volume, less likely hydrocephalus. The third and fourth ventricles  are normal in size. Consider obtaining high-resolution sagittal T2 to  sequence for further evaluation of the cerebral aqueduct and to rule out  cerebral aqueductal stenosis.  The authenticating radiologist has reviewed the images and agrees with  the findings unless otherwise noted in the report.  Â     ASSESSMENT:   Diagnoses for this Visit     ICD-10-CM   1. Septo-optic dysplasia of brain  Q04.4   2. Spasticity  R25.2   3. Hyperreflexia  R29.2     Bao is a 14-year old male with a history of developmental delay and hearing impairment and imaging findings consistent with septo optic dysplasia. On exam demonstrates spasticity, hypertonicity, and hyperreflexia of extremities bilaterally, with his lower extremities much more severely affected than his upper extremities.  Did undergo assessment of HPA axis with endocrinology at Valley Medical Center as a child and results were normal.  On review of records from Valley Medical Center plan had  been to send panel for septo-optic dysplasia however insurance authorization could not be obtained, therefore referred to Stanford genetics for further assessment.    Evaluation today significant for weight loss of 10 pounds in the past 5 months.  Patient's father denies any symptoms or food insecurity and feels it may be related to the patient's lack of motivation to eat.  Reassuringly patient is well-appearing on exam today.  Will reach out to PCP to follow-up with weight check    PLAN:  6. Continue therapies with CCS  7. Refer to genetics  8. Will reach out to PCP to follow up with weight check  9. Follow up in 6-8 months    QI: Seizures Precautions and First-Aid Discussed with Patient/Family? NO     No orders of the defined types were placed in this encounter.    Follow-up visit in six months, or sooner as needed should symptoms worsen or fail to respond to treatment plan as outlined.   Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.

"146",146,1118,FALSE,"","PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY Follow Up Visit  CLINIC VISIT DATE: 2/15/2022      HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Analise M Gutierrez is a 3-month old female seen for follow up after initial consultaiton for congenital hypothyroidism on 11.16.2021.  She had presented at term with profound hypothyroidism; TSH of 152.51 at 24 hours of age and 633 on DOL 6 with free T4 of 0.24.  She was started on 37.5 mcg of levothyroxine by her PMD and instructed on how to give it in the ER. Mom was given a pill cutter and crusher and advised to give in 1 ml syringe. Mom denied symptoms in Analise including lethargy, hoarse cry, feeding problems, constipation. Since that time, there have been ongoing serious concerns and calls to family.  Analise has been followed by GI for persistent jaundice and I have reached out to mom for failure to get labs done on time as requested. Mom c/o problems with getting lab orders sent to Mills Peninsula as a barrier to adherence.  Analise has had persistently abnormal thyroid labs.  I have increased her levothyroxine to 50 and then 62.5 mcg in the past weeks with TSH still elevated as of 2.9.2022.  She was a NO SHOW for her January clinic appointment with me and had not rescheduled until I called her on 2/14/2022.      I have had repeated calls with mom and PMD (Dr. Co) about my concerns that we have not adequately replaced Analise's hypothyroidism.  She was seen last month by Dr. Co for routine WCC and immunizations.  I have communicated my worries as well to GI and requested the assistance of GI social worker (since none currently with endocrinology service).  Family h/o thyroid condition in MGGM and some diabetes.  No congenital hypothyroidism.    Today's call was conducted by telehealth at the request of Analise's mother.  This consultation was performed with the use of secure and encrypted videoconferencing equipment with a trained telehealth presenter. The potential risks and benefits of the telehealth  session were discussed with the patient and/or family, who then verbally consented to participate.  Mom and Analise were """"present"""" throughout the call.  Mom says she gives Analise the levothyroxine (half of a 125 mcg pill  = 62.5 mcg) about 9 am daily, crushed and mixed with water and given by syringe.  She gives about 1-2 hours after the first morning feed.  She has not had vomiting after the dose. She takes Enfamil formula about every 3 hours in the day. Sleeps 10 hours overnight with 2-3 feeds.  Stools 3-4 times/d. No emesis but occasion small amounts of """"spitting up"""" .  Seems to hear well.  """"Moving better side to side"""".  Smiles.  Has had a liver US to evaluate for jaundice that mom says was normal.     Mom is living at home with her mother and sister who help with baby.  She is not in school or working but hopes to do that sometime.  She sees Analise's father 3-4 times a week.

I  increased to 62.5 mcg and planned repeat labs in a month. NO SHOW for appointment on 2.1.2022    Free T4                       1.15  TSH                             116.43    December 8, 2021 on 37.5 mcg - Called mom and increased to 50 mcg   Free T4  1.03  TSH   >150   Â   See HPI    IMAGING:  ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND Â 1/12/2022 1:45 PM     IMPRESSION:   1. Normal size and appearance of the liver and spleen. No biliary duct dilatation.       IMPRESSION:   Analise is a 3-month old female with profound congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed by NBS program and treated from DOL 6 (11/10) with levothyroxine.  This is most likely due to athyreosis or underdevelopment of the thyroid and is almost certainly going to be permanent.  At some point, we could order a thyroid US to look for a gland but this will not change management. At the initial consultation I underscored the importance of adhering to daily medication and frequent blood tests to normalize TSH (goal is 0.5 - 2) in order to optimize outcome developmentally.  This has proven challenging despite calls  from PMD Dr. Co and myself to get labs done promptly.  Mom claims problems with lab orders which I gave mom at last encounter and sent again by me on m 2.3.2022 and by Dr. Co on 2.7.2022. She now says she has the necessary paper copy of orders.     The dose of levothyroxine prescribed (62.5 mcg) is higher than typically required to provide adequate replacement for hypothyroidism but the TSH is still too high.  I will therefore increase one more time to 68.5 mcg (half of a 137 mcg tab) with follow up in three weeks (around March 8, 2022).  I am concerned by the exam today that Analise has coarsened facial features (clinical sign of hypothyroidism).  I underscored again for mom why daily adherence to giving the medication is essential to optimize Analise's chances for normal brain development.     RECOMMENDATIONS:  Standing order for labs at Mills Peninsula - free T4 and TSH  Next labs on 3/8/2022  Increase to 68.5 mcg  mcg (half of 137  mcg tablet) of levothyroxine for now  Appreciate support of GI social worker    Lab studies ordered   Standing order for free T4 and TSH at Mills Peninsula on file    Education/Instructions/Counseling:   See below      Follow up: 2 months in person     I discussed the plan and all recommendations with the family and patient and they expressed understanding and are in agreement of the plan.

Jain, MD PGY-2 Pediatric Resident    2/23/2022    Attending Physician Documentation & Attestation   This patient is critically ill with a high probability of imminent or life-threatening deterioration. He requires constant monitoring and critical care interventions under my direct supervision for the following organ system(s): Respiratory, to treat organ failure and prevent further life-threatening deterioration.  Day of Life: 0    I saw and examined this patient and discussed the management with the resident/fellow. I reviewed the above note and agree with the documented findings and plan of care, which was developed jointly by the resident/fellow and me. I have discussed these plans with staff at the bedside.      Patrick is 25+4/7 week preterm infant male s/p emergent C-section delivery for preterm labor and vaginal bleeding with cord presenting in bulging bag. He currently requires CPAP support for RDS, TPN for nutrition, antibiotics for risk of sepsis, and thermoregulation support. Mother had cervical incompetence and was admitted for betamethasone, Mg for neuroprotection, and Ampicillin. GBS negative. Notably mom tested positive for COVID on day of delivery. Due to worsening contractions, vaginal bleeding, and cord presentation, she was taken for emergent C-section. Infant born after DCC and required CPAP and intermittent PPV with Apgars 4/9. Returned to NICU on CPAP 6, 40% with SpO2 97%.   On exam he is awake and active, AFOF, pink and well perfused, good aeration bilaterally with mild subcostal retractions, RRR without murmur, soft abdomen with 3VC, normal male external genitalia, normal tone.  Plan to place umbilical lines and  initiate TPN at 100 ml/kg/d and follow glucose levels. Maintain on CPAP, check CXR, and follow blood gases. May require intubation/surfactant if FiO2 needs remain elevated. Will send BCx and initiate empiric Amp/Gent. Will need isolation and rapid COVID testing given mother COVID positive at delivery. Discussed care with father at bedside.    I have reviewed the need for the central line: UAC, UVC.  It is necessary for parenteral nutrition, IV antibiotics.  Anticipated duration of clinical necessity is < 1 week.      Valerie Yuk Lan Chock, MD"

Also now underweight, BMI 15.9.     Most recent episode of syncope was last week during her exercise test in clinic but EKG at the time was normal and did not capture arrhythmia. She endorses feeling of heart racing, usually at rest at night. She also endorses dizziness and chest pain not connected to any activity. She gets short of breath when she walks too much. She is currently on 20 mg nadolol BID and does not miss a dose.      Of note her BMI is 15.9 and she has lost weight quickly recently. In clinic on 10/29/21 she was 43.3 kg, and today she is 40.8 kg within just 2 months. Mother states that she notices Heidy is often sad and is also afraid to eat. Heidy states that she is afraid of eating salty or sugary food because she worries it will make her heart race. She also endorses lower energy and mood, lower appetite, and is sleeping more. She wishes she weighed closer to 100 lbs but currently is around 89-90 lbs. She denies any intentional restriction of calories to lose weight. She eats a lot of bland rice and fish. She had menarche at 12-13 yo but since Fall 2021 she has had irregular/no menstrual cycle. She says she is stressed with school as she is a good student and is worried about missing school due to her health. She is also sad about not being able to do the activities she normally likes to do. She does enjoy drawing a lot and still gets bursts of creative energy, but recently has had less interest in drawing.      No recent sick symptoms, URI symptoms, vomiting,  diarrhea.

We are continuing to work on oral intake which has not reached close to goal intake. In addition, she will require loop recorder placement  to monitor her episodes of arrthmia, planned for tomorrow.     I personally spent a total of  35  minutes at the bedside and on the floor/unit with the patient, >50% of which was spent on counseling and/or coordination of care including communicating and discussing results, interpretation and impression with medical staff, patient and family at the bedside, adjustment and review of medications, ordering and scheduling tests and procedures, referring to and communicating with other healthcare professionals, and discharge planning.

Also now underweight, BMI 15.9.     Most recent episode of syncope was last week during her exercise test in clinic but EKG at the time was normal and did not capture arrhythmia. She endorses feeling of heart racing, usually at rest at night. She also endorses dizziness and chest pain not connected to any activity. She gets short of breath when she walks too much. She is currently on 20 mg nadolol BID and does not miss a dose.      Of note her BMI is 15.9 and she has lost weight quickly recently. In clinic on 10/29/21 she was 43.3 kg, and today she is 40.8 kg within just 2 months. Mother states that she notices Heidy is often sad and is also afraid to eat. Heidy states that she is afraid of eating salty or sugary food because she worries it will make her heart race. She also endorses lower energy and mood, lower appetite, and is sleeping more. She wishes she weighed closer to 100 lbs but currently is around 89-90 lbs. She denies any intentional restriction of calories to lose weight. She eats a lot of bland rice and fish. She had menarche at 12-13 yo but since Fall 2021 she has had irregular/no menstrual cycle. She says she is stressed with school as she is a good student and is worried about missing school due to her health. She is also sad about not being able to do the activities she normally likes to do.

EP team follows closely and Mexiletine was started on 1/5 with telemetry now showing decreased ventricular ectopy burden and shortened QTc on EKG. We will continue to monitor her telemetry and QTc duration on current regimen, as well as optimize her nutrition and monitor for refeeding syndrome as we increase her daily caloric intake.     Her ectopy is now under much better control with no ectopy noted overnight. She does not have any evidence of refeeding syndrome.

Source(s) of Information: Parent(s), Patient, LPCH records, outside records, and report from Dr. Martha Nicholson    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Per Heidy and confirmed with mother. Due to language barrier, an interpreter was present during the history-taking and subsequent discussion (and for part of the physical exam) with this patient.    Heidy initially began having disordered eating starting 2 months ago in November 2021 around when she was diagnosed with long QT syndrome. She reports that due to the onset of chest pain, she was unable to eat for 2 weeks and she lost weight. She reports that she was unable to go to school due to being really weak after losing weight. At that time, her mother encouraged her to eat for 2 weeks over which they report that she regained the weight. However, she reports that due to reoccurrence of the chest pain, she again found it difficult to eat. She notes that since early December her appetite has fluctuated and recently has worsened with overall low appetite which she believes is related to being sad and scared about her recent diagnosis. She never had any problems with disordered eating prior to the current episode.    She reports she has never been vegetarian or vegan. She does not restrict food types and typically eats a mix of meats, fruits/vegetables (though mother reports sparingly), milk, and rice. Recently, she and her mother report that she eats less meals than prior.  She has only been eating 1 meal daily at dinnertime and otherwise snacks during the day. Typically she eats 1-2 snacks during the daytime which include Lays chips or a piece of cake. Of note, she doesn't fall asleep until 1am and sleeps throughout the daytime.      She reports for physical activity that she was participating in marching band (plays clarinet) in August through November 2021. However, now her only physical activity is walking around the house. She thinks of herself as too small and wants to gain weight.     ROS:   Positive for dizzy when standing, +chest pain, +heart racing, +abdominal pain at nighttime self-resolves.

She was admitted to LPCH for continuous cardiac monitoring and nutritional rehabilitation on 1/3/2022     In terms of her disordered eating, Heidy does not restrict food types, but has overall  less appetite temporally related to anxiety and sadness in the setting of her new diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome with family history of her father's sudden cardiac arrest at age 38yo. Per patient and parent report, her disordered eating does not pre-date her recent diagnosis, but gradually worsened since the diagnosis in November 2021. To this team, she denies any body image concerns, fear of weight gain/behavior that prevents weight gain, or distorted perception of her body that would be consistent with a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia Nervosa. Given that she has had clinically significant weight loss--no concerns for food insecurity, with no body image distortion, this is more similar to Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), given that there is no indication of GI, food allergy, or malignancy is contributing to this weight loss. At this time however, I would consider this picture as Unspecified Eating Disorder--though we defer to psychiatry for diagnosis, and we will be able to better understand with further observation. While with our team, Heidy has portrayed a desire to eat and gain weight, snacks of chips and cake with a full dinner, describing only decreased interest and volume with upsetting news--with other teams, she has disclosed avoiding salty/sugar/greasy foods and on RD evaluation has described very plain restrictive meals. Will monitor closely for distress with increased nutrition and increased variety of foods. Further, on chart review, her weight loss, bradycardia, and menstrual irregularity predate her Long QT diagnosis/chest pain/decreased intake history.    Unsure of current malnutrition status, given lack of historical height/weight values. Mother uncertain where patient previously fell on the growth chart. If patient was previously closer to average, she is at a very low weight at this time, just above what would necessitate admission. Mother doesn't feel there has been a  significant change before November, which could mean that her baseline is lower. Her new oligomenorrhea, cachectic appearance, and previously mentioned bradycardia seem more concerning for a weight loss that was not noticed by mother and may not be reported/noticed by patient. Will get labs to assess nutrition status. Low weight (less than 65-70%mBMI), acute significant drop in weight, and prolonged lack of caloric intake would place patient at highest risk for refeeding. While our interview with family was less concerning, on review of RD note, patient's intake was about 350kcal/day--so will need to start lower kcal than originally surmised.    At this time, she does not meet criteria for CCP admission: hypothermia (Temp<36.3C), hypotension (BP<90/45), orthostatic changes (HR increase by > 20; SBP decrease by >20 and DBP decrease by >10), severe malnutrition (weight <75% Median BMI), bradycardia (HR =50bpm or =45bpm at night time), or electrolyte abnormalities (serum K<3.5, Phos<3, Mg<1.8). Although prolonged QTc on EKG is a criterion of CCP admission, Heidy has known existing long QT syndrome. However, given the likely contribution of her malnutrition to her increased frequency of ectopy and compromised cardiovascular and safety status, case was discussed with CCP attending and case manager. On review of the case, it was determined that if patient required required additional inpatient nutritional rehabilitation without the local surveillance of cardiology, a prior authorization canbe sought for a period of care at CCP.     Plan:    1. Admitted to cardiology team at LPCH  - May use CCP Eating Disorders Admission order set, which includes diet orders and detailed nursing communication orders      2. FEN  #Nutrition Recommendations  - Diet Tray Order: Per RD with goal of 2000 kcal/day. Strict calorie count.  - Weigh patient (qAM). Weight should be after first morning void and in a gown with patient facing away from  scale (blinded weight)  - Strict intake and output     -- Meals should be planned and selected by RD and provided to patient    -- Patient should not be allowed to select his / her own meals    -- Meals / snacks should be divided into 3 meals and 2 snacks during the day              - Allow 30 minutes to complete meals and 15 minutes to complete snacks              - If does not complete meals or snacks then allow 15 minutes to complete replacement  - Patient should have 1:1 support during meals / snacks and for approximately 1 hour after eating   - Recommend calcium carbonate supplementation  - Recommend adult multivitamin with minerals + iron      #At risk for refeeding On admission K 4.3, Mg 2.1, Phos 3.1, CMP unremarkable  - Monitor Chem 10 qAM  - Recommend maintain cardioprotective electrolytes of K >3.5, Phos >3, Mag >1.8   -- Utilize CCP electrolyte correction order set if repletion is needed     3. CV  - Activity limited to standard medical bedrest  - Continuous cardiorespiratory monitor   - Heart rate (q4h radial pulse)  - Temperature (q4 hr oral temp)  - As patient will require several days of monitoring on cardiology service, it is not necessary to follow regular orthostatic vitals. However, once rhythm is under better control, will begin checking orthostatic vitals for nutrition status to help determine if further care at CCP is appropriate.     4. Laboratory:   - Unremarkable CBC completed on admission  - Recommend ESR, TSH, Free T4, Total T3, LH, FSH, Estradiol, and 25-OH Vitamin D with next lab draw  - Daily chem10     6. Child Psychiatry:   - Appreciate Psychiatry consult     7. Other recommendations/consults:  - Recommend occupational therapy consult for feeding support    8. Dispo  - Heart rate >50 during the day, >45 at night  - Normotensive  - No orthostasis  - Weight > 75% weight at median BMI  - On discharge, should refer to adolescent medicine for 1 week follow-up.    I have discussed my  assessment and plan with the attending physician, Brandii Criss MD and referring physician.    Thank you for involving Adolescent Medicine in your patient's care.

She is accompanied by her mother, from whom additional history was obtained. Last visit was 8/10/21 with me. My last visit with them was 8/10/21    Briefly, Millie is a 8-year old F with a history of congential hydrocephalus and secondary left IVH requiring 3rd ventriculostomy at 3 months of age who presents for follow up of focal seizures. At our last visit, given her good seizure control on increased Zonegran and had referred to Ortho for ankle contracture. Had also considered genetic referral which family declined - as they had seen their team before.    Interval History  - Since our last visit she had no additional episodes concerning for seizure. Last event cf seizure was on 6/26/21. Mother had called after she had 5-6 episodes from 6/25-26 with lip smacking. Events were brief, lasting <1 min (typically 30 seconds) without an obvious post-ictal period.   - Has been tolerating the Zonegran 200mg/250mg (9.3 m/k/d).    - At our last visit, we had placed a referral to ortho for evaluation of ankle contracture -  Family has not yet seen their team.     - School continues to be a challenge for Millie. Mother is working on getting an evaluation at school for learning disability (and associated anxiety). Already is working with the school therapist weekly. Has a 504b plan for accomodations, and is working to get an IEP through the school.   - Re: her services she had previously been getting services with OT and PT through CCS (she does 1 month of  intensive therapy and then takes 3 months off), but not restarted since COVID. Has been doing exercises at home in the interim with PT/OT home plan. Had an AFO for her right foot - unfortunately threw it away (2/2 discomfort and bullying) - mother is working on getting new AFO - still has not gotten a new AFO. Mother feels that her lower extremity function has improved.     Mother unfortunately got COVID recently. Millie did not get sick (and is fully vaccinated)     Subspecialty appointments    06/08/2020: Neurosurgery   - Annual follow up for third ventriculostomy and hydrocephalus; repeat imaging stable with unchanged ventriculomegaly . Recommended follow up in 1 year with repeat FAST MRI at the time. Mother has not yet scheduled this appointment.    12/13/21: Ophthalmology  - Annual follow up; got new glassess, has marketed temproal optic nerve pallor, but stable visual acuity. Follow up in 1 year    Seizure Semiology   1.  GTC  2.  Lipsmacking with nonsensical speech then progressing to right body twitching  - Last event was 9/20/2019 with lipsmaking and nonsensical speech - did not have motor component.     Previous AEDs  1. Keppra - discontinued do to behavioral problems  2. Trileptal - Up to 38 mg/kg/d with level of 37 and continued having seizures. Discontinued 9/2019     Current AEDs  - Zonegran - 200 mg in AM, 250 mg in PM (9.3 mg/kg/d)    Previous Workup:  - given constellation of asymmetric ventriculomegaly, underwent preliminary workup with CGH in 2013 which was reportedly normal.   - Has not had additional genetic workup since developing esotropia    History of Present Illness:  i    ED visit 5/21  """"Amelia is a 4 y/o F with Left IVH with resultant hydrocephalus requiring 3rd ventriculostomy at 3 months of age. Since that time she has continued to follow with neurosurgery and has had no complications no additional interventions. Her previous IVH has left her with right sided weakness, spacticity, and  esotropia.      Mom reports that Amelia was in her usual state of health when she woke up this AM. She went to the bathroom around 900AM and then went back to bed. At 930AM she was laying next to grandma when she developed full body shaking, unresponsive, with eyes open and rolled up. Family immediately called 911. When EMS arrived she continued to have seizure activity so was given Versed x1 with resolution of the episode. She was subsequently tired and taken to a local ED. In the ED Mom reports she was tired, but otherwise acting more like herself. She was transferred to LPCH for neurosurgerical evaluation.     In the ED she was afebrile with normal vital signs for age. CBC, CMP, UA unremarkable. Fast MRI completed and stable. Family reports she is currently back to her baseline.      Given her underlying structural abnormality and increased risk for seizure she was started on Keppra 20 mg/kg BID.""""      Review of Systems:   i  A complete 14-point review of systems is negative, except as noted in the HPI.     Medications:    Current Outpatient Medications   Medication Sig   â€¢ diazePAM (DIASTAT ACUDIAL) 5-7.5-10 mg rectal kit Insert 10 mg into the rectum as needed for seizure longer than 5 minutes.   â€¢ zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 100 mg capsule Take by mouth 2 capsules (200 mg) every morning and 2 capsules (200 mg) every evening.   â€¢ zonisamide (ZONEGRAN) 50 mg capsule Take 1 capsule (50 mg) by mouth every evening.   â€¢ acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 160 mg/5 mL suspension Take by mouth every 6 (six) hours as needed.Reported on 4/6/2017 (Patient not taking: Reported on 8/10/2021)       Allergies:   Adhesive    Past History:  i  Birth History: Born 35 weeks via c-sec 2/2 pre-eclampsia. Prenatally diagnosed with L>R ventriculomegaly and found to have L IVH; mother also with gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism    Past Medical History: IVH, Spastic CP, esotropia, hydrocephalus.   Past Surgical History: 3rd ventriculostomy    Development History:    No language delay, Gross and fine motor delay. Mom reports that she can dress and feed herself.     Family History:  There is no family history of developmental delay, learning problems, seizures, brain tumors, or other neurologic disorders.     Social History:    -- lives at home with Mom and stepdad, step brother and younger full sibling.  -- currently in 2nd grade       Physical Examination:  i  There were no vitals filed for this visit.  Visual Physical Exam:  There were no vitals taken for this visit and the physical exam is minimal due to the nature of the telehealth visit.    General Appearance:  Alert, awake, in no apparent distress  Neurologic Exam:    Mental Status:   Alert, awake. Appropriate affect.   Speech: Speech/verbal output appropriate for age. Speech without dysarthria. Requires frequent re-direction  Cranial Nerves:   Extraocular movements are intact - able to bury sclera in all directions with both eyes. At rest, has esotropia (predominately on the R eye but alternates, at time with L eye deviating medially). There is no nystagmus.No ptosis.  Face is symmetric. Opens and closes eyes symmetrically.  Hearing intact. Shoulder shrug symmetric. Tongue protrudes in midline.   Motor: Limited ROM in RUE compared to LUE, but AG in both.Easily able to stand from bed, but has limited ROM (10 degress in dorsiflexion) in R ankle (walking on toes). No appearance of tremor, dystonia or spasticity.   Coordination:  Finger-to-nose normal bilaterally.  Has slowed finger taps on R.   Gait: Walks on toes on R side      I have reviewed the following reports and have reviewed the imaging studies, and agree with the findings outline below.     Labs:   N/A  Imaging:    No brain MRI results, past 365d.    EEG:  EEG Routine (Report date: 6/4/2018)  INTERPRETATION:   This EEG is ABNORMAL due to:    -prominent left hemispheric slowing  -excess beta frequency on the right   -right hemispheric  attenuation  -rare left occipital sharps     Comments:   Focal slowing indicates cerebral dysfunction from a wide variety of potential etiologies in the region affected; it is a non-specific indicator of a structural or functional abnormality. Focal epileptiform potentials can be seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, but do not in themselves confirm a diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy. The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges indicates an increasd risk of seizures. Sleep was not captured.         ASSESSMENT:  Amelia is a 8-year old female with a history of ventriculomegaly detected in utero likely 2/2 left IVH with resultant hydrocephalus requiring 3rd ventriculostomy at 3 months of age who presents for follow up of focal seizures currently on Zonegran. Her neurologic exam remains stable with no new neurologic symptoms. Fast MRI 06/2020 stable.    Since our last appointment she has not had any additional events cf seizure since we increased her zonegran. If she has continued seizures, she has room to increase her Zonegran, but if she fails that medication would discuss possible surgerical work up. At this time, we have suspected that her lipsmacking events are seizures, but have not captured any events on EEG. And given their relative low frequency of occurrence, would likely require medication wean for event capture should surgical evaluation be considered.     Regarding her other areas of development, it is important that she continue with PT/OT for her gross and fine motor delay. Family is working on reestablishing services through CCS and evaluation with IEP at school for additional support. As previously stated, she does require ongoing PT/OT services for her R sided weakness and R ankle contractures, particularly as she appears to be compensating with her gait (leaning towards the L) from her R sided ankle contracture. She requires re-assessment in particular for AFO fitting - and referral  has also been placed to orthopedic surgery for possible surgical evaluation.    The primary encounter diagnosis was Localization-related focal epilepsy with complex partial seizures. Diagnoses of Hydrocephalus, congenital, Right hemiparesis, Esotropia, and Developmental delay were also pertinent to this visit.

Interpreted by Attending Radiologist: Carolina Guimaraes, MD  Electronically Signed: 6/20/2021 9:01 AM  Authored By    : Carolina Guimaraes, MD Approval Date : 6/20/2021 9:01 AM  Signed         EEG:    AMBULATORY EEG (Report date: 6/29/2021)  SUMMARY REPORT - INTERPRETATION:   This EEG is ABNORMAL due to:   - Frequent bilateral independent temporal sharps and spikes. These became abundant on the left side during sleep with a SWI 71%.   - Right temporal slowing   Â   Comments:    Focal slowing indicates cerebral dysfunction from a wide variety of potential etiologies in the region affected; it is a non-specific indicator of a structural or functional abnormality. Focal epileptiform potentials can be seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, but do not in themselves confirm a diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy. The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges indicates an increased risk of seizures.    AMBULATORY EEG  (Report date: 8/13/2021)  SUMMARY REPORT - INTERPRETATION:   This EEG is ABNORMAL due to:   - Frequent bilateral independent frontal and temporal sharps and spikes in wakefulness. These became abundant during sleep and remain multifocal independent and harder to assess for ESES as clearly independent sharps, spikes and slowing.  The right hemisphere in particular has slowing with some low voltage sharps.  A spike wave index (SWI) was calculated from 22:05:43 to 22:10:43 (for 5 minutes) starting after the waking background rhythm had disappeared for 5 minutes. Over the next 5 minutes, the number of seconds containing at least one spike wave was scored. Qualitatively, SWI  was not as elevated throughout all of non-REM sleep.    -  214 /300  71 % on the left had spikes  - 227 /300  75%on the right had sharps rare spikes and much more irregular and slowing with admixed sharply contoured waves.   - right sided slowing, with poorer sleep architecture in the right hemisphere.   Â   Comments:    Focal slowing indicates cerebral dysfunction from a wide variety of potential etiologies in the region affected; it is a non-specific indicator of a structural or functional abnormality. Focal epileptiform potentials can be seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, but do not in themselves confirm a diagnosis of seizures or epilepsy. The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges indicates an increased risk of seizures.    ASSESSMENT:   Benito is a 10-year old male with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured AVM in 2017, s/p VP shunt and craniectomy, now s/p resection residual AVM 5/29/20 and bone flap replacement 2/2021, with sequelae of left spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy, left homonymous hemianopsia, and symptomatic localization-related epilepsy.     No clear clinical seizures since 5/2017 at time of AVM rupture and no clinical seizures occurred when he ran out of medication in 2021 briefly.  However, he has had 2 recent EEGs that showed abundant epileptiform activity, activated by sleep, and the interictal burden of epileptiform activity and behavioral issues did not improve with increasing oxcarbazepine to therapeutic dosing. The spike-wave index was slightly below threshold for electrographic status epilepticus of sleep and there is no definite correlate of regression. He was having increased behavioral issues and while these are primarily occurring at home and therefore seem situational rather than related to epileptiform activity, given the high risk for seizure based on structural abnormality plus EEG findings, would recommend continuing seizure medication for now. He has had improvement in behavioral issues since changing from oxcarbazepine to valproic acid. Will repeat EEG to see if spike burden has deceased with transition to valproic acid, but will not necessarily chase EEG pattern with higher seizure medication dosing unless there are clear seizures or clinical correlate.      The primary encounter diagnosis was Symptomatic localization-related epilepsy. Diagnoses of Spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy and AVM (arteriovenous malformation) brain were also pertinent to this visit.

Severe persistent asthma without complication    2. Allergy to American house dust mite    3. Allergy to European house dust mite      Rodrigo is a 8-year old male with severe persistent asthma in good control.He is doing better on Symbicort 80.  I spent a lot of time today going through how to use this medication and the smart plan correctly.  He has not needed prednisone on the new medication for his most recent cold which is progress.  Today I trained him for the big boy technique using the mouthpiece with a 10-second breath-hold.  He was causing a slight alarm with his 2 rapid inhalation and we worked on slowing this.    Dustmite allergy/rhinitis: Mom doing a good job in her home. Dad had carpeting, but overall details of his environment unknown to me.  Mom has Claritin for daily use but stopped using it.     Coronavirus: We reviewed coronavirus today All adults have vaccine now.  He was nervous about getting his vaccine we discussed this directly today and I encouraged him to get it right away.  We talked about ways to treat with  Tylenol or an ice cube on his arm so that he does not have significant discomfort.  He did get his flu shot without any problem.  I checked his mask fit which was poor and trained him in the not and talk skill so he can fit his mask better.  He is good about wearing a mask and hand hygiene  Patient education:  Reviewed basic pathophysiology  Reviewed infection control measures, hand hygiene and vaccinationsReviewed skills for appropriate medication administration with chamber and inhaler  Reviewed asthma action plan              PLAN:  Patient Instructions     Action Plan for  Rodrigo  Date:1/10/2022    DUSTMITE ALLERGY IS SEVERE  DUSTMITE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL MEASURES CAN HELP ASTHMA CONTROL  Cover mattress and pillow with dustmite covers. These are available on line  Wash bedding weekly in hot water (over 130 degrees) include all the bedding  Wash stuffed animals wash and dry to kill the dustmites, limit number on the bed rotate the favorites 1 at a time  Special and fragile stuffed animals can be placed in freezer for 3d to kill dustmites too. A good rule of thumb is a good stuffed animal will be fine in washer and drier. It is well made and less likely to release fibers. If your stuffed animals fall apart in the washer they are likely releasing more fibers and dust and should be given away or recycled to a non allergic person  Keep the room clean, well dusted and vacuumed weekly  Floors should be a solid surface, wood, vinyl, even plastic over rugs you can not remove etc  The most important thing you can do to control the dustmite is dehumidification. The dustmites all die if humidity under 60% and even under 70% very helpful. To do this you need a room hygrometer - a device that measures the humidity and a dehumidifier. This plugs in, runs in her bedroom and removes moisture from the air. Every day you need to dump the water collection bin. You will be impressed at the amount of moisture removed.    GREEN  ZONE: well without trouble from asthma  Remember your hand hygiene!  Use soap and water for at least 60 seconds.      To give a puff of inhaler medication: If inhaler not used for 2 week or more waste 2 puff into the air  Shake inhaler well (20x)  Take off the cap and insert into the rubber fitting of the chamber  Put the mask over nose and mouth  Puff 1 dose of medicine into chamber  Take 6 slow deep breaths in and out Count off the breaths with the mask in place   Remove the mask and rest about 1 minute then repeat shaking and administer the second puff  Be sure to assess 20 minutes later    Symbicort 80 2 puff twice daily  Loratidine 5 mg daily as needed    YELLOW ZONE: for any onset of cold, runny nose, Use the Symbicort more often,  Up to 8 puff in a day.  If this is not enough add duo neb from your machine  If clears fully use at least 2 times daily during any type of cold, and if symptoms return use again in the day up to 8x daily if every time you use it, symptoms fully clear.    If after first 2 puffs is not fully clear, still has symptoms, of cough or wheeze, but no worse then repeat 2 puff again right at 20 min and recheck in 20 min.    If after first 2 puffs you see getting worse anyway, faster, more labored breathing, grunting, retractions etc.  Go to red zone plan    If in Yellow zone: for more than 3 days, then CALL PULMONARY FOR ADVICE    RED ZONE: medications not working well, cough, wheezing, retractions and flaring.   Symbicort should be at 2 puff 4 times daily and then Duoneb by machine,  Can take 3 times in 1 hour.  After the 12 puffs or 3 nebulized treatment track for symptom control over the next 4 hours.    If symptoms clear/go away after the treatment and for 4 hours it means you are back to the yellow zone, Go there now and give 2 puff albuterol and follow yellow zone plan.    If never achieves clear OR symptoms return in under 4 hours It is time to start  Prednisone 60 mg (3 tablets) taken  with food.  Can swallow or crush    Daily for 5 days. If taking this medicine in AM sleep is less disrupted.    When ever in the red zone and especially if Prednisone required You must see a doctor this same day.

In 2015, she underwent mandibular distraction. She has also undergone hardware removal from the distraction in October 2016. She continues on overnight CPAP for severe obstructive sleep apnea.    INTERVAL HISTORY 2/3/22  Has not been taking Spiriva (control) and has not needed to take Symbicort as rescue. Forgets to take controller because she keeps it in bathroom away from other medications. Took it once last week only.   Has not had any issues with shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness. Able to climb stairs with mild difficulty with mask.    Received new CPAP and using at 8 cmH20- had titration study done in January, scoring and final results not yet back but Dr. Okorie briefly reviewed and said she had no desaturations and a CPCP of 8 cm H20 appears to be her setting.

BiPAP 8/4 was initiated, and she didn't like it due to anxiety. Then the patient trialed CPAP with both a nasal and full face mask. The patient preferred the small Fisher & Paykel Simplus full face mask on a CPAP of 5cmH2O and found it very comfortable. Ending CPAP settings were 9cmH2O, EPR off using a small Fisher & Paykel Simplus full face mask with heated humidifier and climate tubing.     Sleep study repeated in January 2022, pending read- see above for preliminary    Sleep routine: Unchanged, she usually falls asleep around 11-11:30. She falls asleep quickly. For the most part the snoring has improved. She sleeps in her mother's bed which is a therapeutic bed and will often raise the head and sleeps better.     Diet: Biggest challenge is that she continues to gain weight. On OTC and thinks that could be a problem.     Menstruation: Still a problem, being followed closely in Adolescent medicine.

On exam, his visual acuity was normal 20/20 in both eyes.   There was no cranial neuropathy or misalignment. The HVF shows a left upper eyelid artifact The optic nerves were normal.     A focused list of diagnoses/concerns pertaining or related to neuro-ophthalmology include:      Â¨ Bilateral ptosis: this is likely congenital ptosis that has progressed.  I do not see any signs of fatigability to suggest myasthenia gravis.  There is no ophthalmoparesis to suggest chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) or oculopharyngeal pharyngeal myotonic dystrophy (OPMD).  I do not think further workup for a neurogenic process is needed at this time, although I cannot be fully certain there is none.     Â¨ Visually significant ptosis: there is a lid artifact on HVF and recommend ptosis repair bilaterally.        PLAN:  â€¢ Discuss ptosis repair with by Dr. Lorenz  â€¢ Continue follow ups with local optometrist to update prescription glasses    Follow Up:  I would be happy to see them back in clinic, but did not make a follow up appointment for them.

Note completed by: Alaina Butler, MD PGY-2  2/21/2022    Teaching Physician Attestation     I saw and examined the patient and discussed his management with the resident/fellow. I reviewed the resident/fellow's note and agree with the documented findings and plan of care.     Attending Narrative:Â Â Â   Aimar is a 3 month old with new diagnosis of bilateral retinoblastoma (stage E in the right eye and stage D+ in the left eye) with possible involvement of the right optic nerve. Given the c/f possible optic nerve involvement, we completed staging LP and bilateral bone marrow aspirates/biopsiesÂ on 2/18. He will have right eye enucleation on 2/20 with Dr. Mruthyunjaya. He is recovering well from this and has good pain control with his current regimen. We are awaiting pathology results from CSF, bone marrow and right eye enucleation to guide systemic therapy planning. He is breastfeeding a bit better this AM but not at baseline so we decrease fluids to 1/2M and will monitor UOP. We've reached out to audiology to confirm results of OAEs from last week and to see if we can arrange for baseline ABR this week prior to chemotherapy. We've also reached out to social work given concerns for food insecurity and need for further evaluation of  needs.    Jacquelyn Nicole Crane, MD"
"192",192,3090,FALSE,"","ONCOLOGY PRIMARY ATTENDING NOTE    Date: 2/19/22    I met in person with the parents in the presence of Jenna Galbo, RN (Aimar's bedside nurse) and with the assistance of a Mixtec interpreter via telephone.  We discussed the following information:    Â· We have confirmed based on eye exam and MRI scan that Aimar has retinoblastoma  Â· Retinoblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that is rare (about 1% of childhood cancers)  Â· Management of retinoblastoma is complex and requires a specialized team.  We have a specialized team to manage children with retinoblastoma here at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford.  This team includes:  Â· A cancer specialist called an oncologist who administers chemotherapy (medicines that kill cancer cells) and works with the eye specialist to develop a treatment plan.  I will be Aimar's oncologist based on my expertise in retinoblastoma.  Â· An eye specialist called an ophthalmologist who specializes in retinoblastoma.  The ophthalmologist examines the eyes frequently, administers various treatments directly into the eye (injecting chemotherapy medicines into the eye, using lasers or freezing to kill retinoblastoma cells in the eyes), and does surgery to remove the eye when necessary.  The ophthalmologist works closely with the oncologist to develop a treatment plan.  Dr. Prithvi Mruthyunjaya is the ophthalmologist here with retinoblastoma expertise.  Â· A genetic counselor, who determines whether Aimar's retinoblastoma was inherited from one of his parents.  If it was inherited, other family members may be at risk for developing retinoblastoma also.  Â· Children with retinoblastoma in both eyes develop the disease because all of the cells that make up their body are abnormal.  In the eyes, these abnormal cells can develop into retinoblastoma.  Because Aimar has retinoblastoma in both eyes, we know that he has an abnormality in the genetic material in all of his cells that caused  these cancers to develop in his eyes.  Â· Aimar may have the abnormality in all of his body's cells for one of 2 reasons: 1) He inherited this abnormality from one of his parents.  About 1 in every 5 children with retinoblastoma inherited the risk for this cancer to develop from one of their parents.  2) He developed this abnormality very early in his development as a fetus.  About 4 in every 5 children with retinoblastoma affecting both eyes developed the abnormality in their cells early in their development.  Â· We will arrange for Aimar's parents to meet with the genetic counselor to discuss testing that will be done to identify the specific abnormality in Aimar's cells and to then determine whether that abnormality came from one of his parents.  Â· Whether or not Aimar inherited a risk for retinoblastoma from one of his parents, we do not really understand why this cancer develops.  His parents did not do anything that caused this cancer, and nothing that they did not do caused this cancer.  Â· The treatment for retinoblastoma depends on how much cancer is present in each eye and whether the cancer has spread outside of the eye.  Â· The retinoblastoma in Aimar's right eye is very large and has caused damage to the eye that cannot be reversed.  Even if we could kill the cancer cells in the right eye, the eye would never be able to see, it will likely become painful, and over time it will shrivel up and be cosmetically unappealing.  Although we wish that we could save the right eye, it unfortunately will have to be removed to cure the cancer and to leave him with a good cosmetic appearance.  Â· Several months after removing the eye, a prosthetic eye will be placed in the eye socket. This eye will not see, but it should look very similar to the other eye and it may be difficult for others to know that it is not real.  An ocularist, who specializes in making these prosthetic eyes, will periodically increase the size of  the eye as Aimar grows and will polish and care for the prosthesis.  Â· The tumor in Aimar's left eye is large, but it has not caused as much damage to the eye as the tumor in the right eye.  We are therefore hopeful that we will be able to shrink the retinoblastoma in the left eye and prevent Aimar from needing the left eye to be removed surgically.  Unfortunately, though, the retinoblastoma in the left eye is also affecting the part of the eye most important to vision.  Even if we are able to get rid of the retinoblastoma, it is quite possible that Aimar's vision will be significant decreased because of damage that the cancer has done to the eye.  Only time will tell how much vision Aimar will have in the left eye.  Â· Because Aimar has large tumors in both eyes, we know that he will need to receive chemotherapy (medicines that kill cancer cells) to cure the cancer  Â· The type of chemotherapy given will depend on whether or not we find retinoblastoma cells outside of the eye.  The spinal fluid and bone marrow that were collected yesterday in the OR will be checked for retinoblastoma cells; we should have these results by the middle of next week.  When the right eye is removed, the pathologist (who specializes in looking at cancers under the microscope) will determine whether the retinoblastoma is close to the end of the nerve that attaches the eye to the brain.  If any of these evaluations find retinoblastoma outside of the eye, Aimar will require more intensive treatment that will include chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant (a procedure we will discuss further if it is needed, but which includes very high doses of chemotherapy).  Â· If no retinoblastoma cells are outside of the eye, then Aimar will require milder chemotherapy.  This chemotherapy is given once each month for 6 months.  The chemotherapy is given over 2 days in the outpatient infusion center, and does not require hospitalization.  Most children  who receive this chemotherapy tolerate it very well.  Â· We will discuss the schedule and side effects of chemotherapy in much greater detail once we determine which type of chemotherapy will be needed.  The subcutaneous port that was placed yesterday in the OR will allow us to give chemotherapy into the bloodstream and to draw blood as needed to monitor how well Aimar is tolerating the chemotherapy.  Â· During the chemotherapy treatment, Aimar's left eye will be examined frequently -- initially every few weeks and over time less often -- by Dr. Mruthyunjaya.  This will help us to determine how well the chemotherapy is working and, as he gets older, how well he is able to see.  It is also possible that Dr. Mruthyunjaya will give some treatments into the left eye (injecting chemotherapy into the eye or using lasers or freezing to kill some of the retinoblastoma cells in the eye).    During this discussion, both parents appeared to be fully engaged in the conversation and asked good questions that indicated to me that they were understanding the information shared.  They told me that they have a 6 year old son (Edgar) and a 3 year old daughter (Lisbet) back in Mexico living with dad's parents, and that they came to the US to earn money and were planning to go back in 5 years.  They live in a single room in a home that houses another family.  There are extended family in the area, but those family members can provide limited support since they have jobs and families of their own.  Father works packing food in a warehouse, and mother cares for Aimar.  Their financial resources are very limited, although they have a car for transportation.  We will need to ensure that mother, in particular, has enough to eat since she is breastfeeding.  I was told that mother had been given a meal card that will allow her to get extra food while they are here in the hospital, but we'll need to have an outpatient social worker make sure  that their food insecurity is addressed.    After I finished speaking to the family, Dr. Mruthyunjaya joined the call to speak to the family about the planned enucleation that will be performed tomorrow.  I will check with Pathology to see when we will have results on the eye pathology, CSF cytology, and bone marrow aspirates/biopsies so we can start chemotherapy, and will communicate with the inpatient team on Monday about that anticipated timeline so discharge planning can proceed.    I spent a total of 75 minutes face-to-face with the family today for this discussion.    Sheri L. Spunt, MD, MBA  Oncology Attending Physician"

For each statement, please tell me whether the statement was often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months.  1. â€œWe worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.â€ sometimes true   2. â€œThe food we bought just didnâ€™t last, and we didnâ€™t have money to get more.â€ never true      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  i  Vital Signs:  BP 113/70 (BP Location: Left arm, BP Method: Automatic, BP Cuff Size: Adult)  | Pulse 127  | Ht 146.6 cm (4' 9.72"""")  | Wt 51.6 kg (113 lb 13.9 oz)  | HC 57 cm (22.44"""")  | BMI 24.03 kg/mÂ²    General:  General: well appearing, no acute distress  HENT: normocephalic, slightly elongated face and nose, palate intact, moist mucus membranes    Neurologic:  Mental status: awake, alert, speaks in sentences, takes longer to answer questions, can follow simple commands, more difficulty with complex commands  Cranial nerves:   II: PERRL  III, IV, VI: EOMI, no ptosis or nystagmus  V: facial sensation intact to light touch  VII: face symmetric at rest and with movement  VIII: hearing grossly intact  IX, X: palate elevates  symmetrically, no dysarthria  XII: tongue midline  XI: shoulder shrug 5/5  Motor/musculoskeletal: normal bulk and tone, no pronator drift, 5/5 on confrontational testing proximally and distally, fast finger taps symmetric, no extraneous movements  DTR: 2+ and symmetric at biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and ankle jerks, no ankle clonus  Sensory: grossly intact and symmetric to light touch.

EEG:  none    ASSESSMENT:   Rony is a 10-year old male with moderate intellectual disability, speech delay and autistic features of unclear etiology. Special education services are indicated. Fragile X, karyotype and array CGH unrevealing. In terms of etiology, we discussed that intellectual disability may be multifactorial, with possible genetic and environmental factors. Genetic testing is more likely to be informative than neuroimaging because his neurologic exam is otherwise normal; however we can revisit utility of MRI brain at follow up visits, especially if it would help with phenotype and interpretation of genetic testing.     Family also reported food insecurity today.     The primary encounter diagnosis was Intellectual disability with language impairment and autistic features. A diagnosis of Food insecurity was also pertinent to this visit.

Miguel was accompanied by his legal gaurdian.    The last visit in Rheumatology was on 8/26/2021.  Â   Labs notable for:  ANAÂ negative, RFÂ negative, Anti-CCP abÂ negative, Anti-Sm negative  Â   Miguel is followed by Stanford Children's Health Specialty Pharmacy. For outpatient medication questions, please call 650-725-9600.  Â   Disease presentation/course:  Miguel was admitted to LPCH 8/2020 after being transferred from OSH for severe bilateral leg pain that prevented him from walking.Â Â In addition, and the outside hospital he had elevated inflammatory markers with ESR>130, as well as anemia and thrombocytosis. Â He had recently been started on iron for presumed iron deficiency anemia.  Â   Per Miguel, he has had joint pain for many months, with at least 3 months of persistent pain, especially in his left elbow, right knee, and fingers and toes bilaterally. Â The pain has worsened over time to the point of where he could not walk. Â His initial exam was remarkable for left elbow flexion contracture, slight right knee flexion contracture with swelling and tenderness on palpation, fifth digit on the right hand swelling, warmth and decreased range of motion with tenderness on exam, and multiple swollen toes, most markedly the second and third toe on the left foot which were painful on range of motion. His ankles were also swollen bilaterally without decreased ROM.Â He had x-rays during the admission which were remarkable for multiple erosions, especially in feet and effusions of left elbow and right knee.  Â   During admission, he was found to have negative ANA, RF, anti-CCP. Â He was started on naproxen 500 mg twice daily with significant improvement in his pain, and initiated methotrexate prior to discharge with plan to  initiate Humira as an outpatient. Â He was also started on folic acid, and vitamin D was pending on discharge. He also worked with physical therapy during admission to increase his mobility and he has a referral for discharge.  Â   He also endorsed a significant weight loss (around 60 pounds) which was at least partially due to decreased appetite which has improved over the month prior to admission. Â He was unaware of the weight loss until he was told his weight on admission. Â Given this profound weight loss, and concern for arthritis on exam, GI was consulted to evaluate for IBD. Â However, he did not have history of IBD symptoms and therefore a calprotectin was sent but no further work-up was initiated. Â His calprotectin was normal. Celiac and thyroid work up were normal as well.  Â   He has been receiving Humira 40 mg Q14 days and Methotrexate weekly as well as folic acid since 9/1/2020Â without issue.Â Methotrexate started to be decreased 8/2021.  Â    At his visit 8/26/2021, he was doing well from psoriasis and arthritis perspective, but continued to have an active left large toe infection (first noticed at April 2021 visit). We cultured the purulent drainage, and recommended he be seen by PCP. Culture was positive for gram positive cocci in pairs (staph aureus) and mupirocin was prescribed but there was no evidence of infection in his blood so systemic antibiotics were not given. Nonetheless, given his inactive disease but chronic infection, methotrexate was decreased to 12.5 mg weekly (for ease, 0.5 mL weekly).   Â   In addition, at last visit he was continuing to lose weight. He and grandmother denied food insecurity and report he has a good appetite.  Â   Last Quaniferon 4/2021  Â      Interval History: Miguel reports his appetite continues to improve, and he has regained some weight. He has been using the lower dose of weekly methotrexate (12.5 mg) without difficulty, but was recently sent a new kind of methotrexate  pen that he doesn't know how to use. He also got two doses of the COVID vaccination, without issue. He continues to take Humira every other week as well without issue.    His toe completed healed and has not returned. He does have some lesions on his forehead that his grandma thinks is acne, that he would like checked out.    He also reports frequent feelings of anxiety, and is interested in medication to treat anxiety. His grandmother takes pills for anxiety.

He is compliant with his medications and without side effects at this time. He has no issues taking his Humira or methotrexate. No active joint pains or skin issues. We started to wean the methotrexate at the last visit to 0.5 mL weekly or 12.5 mg. Since this wean, he continued to do well. Today, his toe is completely healed from prior infection and his joints continue to be inactive. Therefore, recommend discontinuing methotrexate completely and continuing Humira every other week.    We also discussed a third dose of the COVID vaccine, given that he is immunocompromised. We will also obtain blood work today, and will call grandma with results of blood work.Â     In regards to lesions on face, it does not appear like psoriasis and favor acne diagnosis. Reviewed skin hygiene, and ordered benzoyl peroxide gel for lesions. However, also recommend establishing care with new PCP to discuss further.    Finally, in regards to anxiety, recommended establishing care with mental  health resources and discussed possible other interventions besides medication. Miguel is open to these options; appreciate Gianna, our social worker's support in discussing with Miguel how to establish with these resources.

Adolescent Medicine was consulted for weight loss with history of AN as well as for reproductive health/contraception counseling. Despite small weight loss, Lucy continues to report that she eats 3 meals and 2 snacks most days of the week. Her purging frequency has improved from up to 10x/week to ~1x/week currently. In addition, she is not orthostatic and has resumed menstruation. Taken together, her eating disorder is relatively stable or improved overall after discharge from Chicago inpatient eating disorder facility in early December 2021. Her reproductive health is more our focus as she was previously on OCPs, but is not currently and does not have interest in restarting (please see HEADSS for more detail). Overall, we provided information and education on other contraception options.    Recommendations:  > Please obtain RPR (GC, Chlamydia and HIV screening already performed  > Follow up in Adolescent gynecology clinic after discharge (to separate her reproductive health care from her care in Eating Disorders Clinic )  > Adolescent Medicine will continue to follow her while admitted    I have discussed my assessment and recommendations with the attending physician, Dr. Golden .

Telehealth Benefits    â€¢ More Convenient and Accessible Patient Care   â€¢ Increased Patient Engagement through maintenance of appointments and care schedules   â€¢ Decreased Travel Stress for Patients  â€¢ Cost Savings (Gas, Time Off, Travel Expenses)     Telehealth Risks    â€¢ Insufficient information transmission (e.g. poor resolution) to allow appropriate medical decision making  â€¢ Limitation: Inability to conduct all types of evaluations over a virtual visit   â€¢ The need to follow-up with an in-person evaluation may arise post telehealth visit   â€¢ Delays in medical evaluation or treatment due to deficiencies of the technology being used   â€¢ Limited Privacy: Patient may not be in a private location at time of visit   â€¢ Treatment options may be limited (e.g. making certain prescriptions)        Interval History:   Noah has started walking. He started walking in October 2021.     With language, mom says he is not saying much at all. He passed audiology testing, but mom hasn't heard from speech therapy at Children's Madera Hospital about scheduling yet. Early intervention has mentioned they  are concerned about his speech but haven't been able to schedule with them either.     He has a therapist from Early Start 2 times per month for in home therapy.     He seems to understand things. He can follow something if mom says 'give me...' Mom says makes eye contact but not as much as other kids his age. He smiles and laughs responsively. He will grab mom's hand to bring him to something for her to get for him, but then won't point at it and seems to want mom to guess what it is. He responds to his name, but sometimes she needs to say it a few times before he will respond. He does show interest in playing with others. He does not point to body parts yet. Mom says not very worried about autism but that on early intervention assessment she was told had some lower scores and that they were recommending additional therapy.     Mom does not think there is regression, but feels like somewhat plateau in progression after he started walking. She says that he is going to start Head Start soon.     With a small object, he uses a raking grasp still, not using mature pincer, but will try to use utensils to eat.     He got braces for legs in December 2021, but hasn't had a chance to use them with therapist yet because they were waiting for insurance authorization for additional sessions with PT. Mom notes that he still falls a lot with or without braces; seems like legs give out.     No events concerning for seizure.     Mom thinks OFC has been overall stable but that as he gets bigger, the plagiocephaly is more noticeable.     Review of Systems:   A complete 14-point review of systems is negative, except as noted in the HPI.     Medications:    No current outpatient medications on file.       Allergies:   Patient has no known allergies.    Past History:  i  Birth History: Per mom, Delivered 2-3 weeks prior to due date, spontaneous delivery, vaginal. They used vacuum assist, took 3-4 minutes before started crying in  delivery room, mom says needed lots of suction and she was told there was a lot of fluid. No reports of meconium. No concerns about heart rate during delivery. Stayed with mom in well baby. Home on DOL3. Mom felt like movements were a little less during pregnancy compared with others. He was largest of her 4 kids. Otherwise no concerns during the pregnancy.  No issues with feeding in newborn period or since.   Â   Past Medical History: global developmental delay, hypotonia, plagiocephaly  Past Surgical History: none   Â   Family History:    - 2 brothers, 1 sister with normal development  - no cardiomyopathy, no muscular dystrophy, no joint hyperextensibility, use of orthotics, early loss of ambulation, developmental delay   Â   Mom OFC 53.5 cm  Dad is felt to have a large head but OFC is not known   Â   Social History:    -- lives at home with mother and 3 siblings   -- father visits occasionally and does not help with finances   -- mom is working; has childcare through Head Start; she feels has sufficient resources for groceries, cost of living right now but there have been concerns for food insecurity in the past    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital Signs:  There were no vitals taken for this visit.  Visual Physical Exam:  There were no vitals taken for this visit and the physical exam is minimal due to the nature of the telehealth visit.    General Appearance:  Alert, awake, in no apparent distress  Neurologic Exam:    Mental Status:   Alert, awake. Attentive to mom and to camera.    Speech: Vocalizes but no clear babbling. No words.   Cranial Nerves:   EOM appear to be full and conjugate. No nystagmus.  Face is symmetric but with hypotonic appearance of mouth (open at rest, with some tenting). Opens and closes eyes symmetrically. He was able to demonstrate a quadruped crawl.    Motor: Moves upper and lower limbs symmetrically. Tone appears low in legs and trunk by observation. He 'W' sits.   Coordination:  He was able  to grasp an object (plant with stem) in each hand and transfer. No truncal titubation and no dysmetria.    Gait: He can pull self up to standing holding onto mom's hand. He could walk independently, slightly wide base with hyperextension at knees. He was able to stoop and lower self down to ground safely.       Labs:    TSH normal   CK borderline at 213    Imaging: none   No brain MRI results, past 365d.      ASSESSMENT:   Diagnoses for this Visit     ICD-10-CM   1. Global developmental delay  F88   2. Muscle weakness (generalized)  M62.81     Noah is a now 19-month old male with a history of reduced fetal movements during pregnancy, macrocephaly, gross motor delay and axial > appendicular hypotonia on exam. He has continued to make progress over time and responds well to early intervention/therapy services. His OFC has started to level off and favors a familial benign macrocephaly. Prior exam reassuring against a neuromuscular disorder or muscular dystrophy. No distinct upper motor neuron features on exam. Over time, language and fine motor skills also delayed and question borderline social-emotional development, though no frank autistic features per mom. Clinical exam favors a central hypotonia over neuromuscular disorder, but with borderline CK and absence of distinct upper motor neuron features would still consider a mild myopathy; neuropathy and neuronopathy unlikely based on preserved/brisk reflexes and muscular dystrophy less likely based on CK level. Congenital myasthenic syndrome also unlikely in absence of fluctuating tone/weakness.     There is ongoing need for PT and early intervention services. Speech therapy is also indicated given significant expressive > receptive speech delay.   Â   Because it has also become apparent that he has global rather than isolated gross motor delay, will consider neuroimaging, genetic and metabolic testing.     PLAN:  1. Continue early intervention services. Recommend add  speech therapy. Mom will send me contact information for her early start coordinator so that I can help facilitate this request.    2. Referral to Development and Behavioral Pediatrics to aid in diagnostic developmental assessment and guide any treatment recommendations   3. In person visit with me in next 2-3 months for more detailed neurologic exam. Can discuss MRI brain, additional labs at that time.     QI: Seizures Precautions and First-Aid Discussed with Patient/Family? N/A     Orders Placed This Encounter   Procedures   â€¢ Ambulatory referral to Development Behavioral Pediatrics     Follow-up visit in 2-3 months, or sooner as needed should symptoms worsen or fail to respond to treatment plan as outlined.

Parents have struggled to get him to eat enough and are concerned that he """"spits up"""" frequently after eating and he has failed to gain weight appropriately. Initially had been trying to breastfeed and combination breast and bottle feeding, but in consultation with pediatrician and GI doctors has been using formula plus fortified breast milk to try to gain weight more quickly. He has had an extensive workup so far including two prior admissions:    First admission was on 12/14/2021 for failure to thrive thought to be due to inadequate caloric intake.  Workup at that time included evaluation by:   - OT, which revealed a normal suck/swallow   - Nutrition, who provided recommendations on optimal caloric intake for age   - GI, who had a low concern for any intraabdominal pathology; abdominal ultrasound obtained at that time was normal   - Cardiology; CXR obtained during admission notable for """"prominent aortic knob"""",  However echocardiogram performed revealed a normal aortic arch & anatomy   - Thyroid studies obtained during admission were normal     Second admission was on 1/13/2022:   - Swallow study showed competent feeding   - GI involved again, who recommended indirect calorimetry to assess resting metabolic demands & stool studies (His stool guaiac, lactate, ammonia, and pyruvate returned negative)   - Genetics was consulted for metabolic workup; carnitine, acylcarnitine, PAA, UOA, urine amino acids, & lactate; all within normal limits   - Dietary was involved  again for optimization of feeds.  Cameron was continued on Gerber Good Start but fortified to 24kcal formula with goal feed volumes of 75ml q3hr (or 8 times per day). He tolerated feeds of up to 90ml and was able to gain goal weights of an average 30g/day.    Since discharge on 1/17, he has been seen regularly by PCP and GI. He has not met interval weight gain goal of 30 g/day.  His weight upon discharge was 4550 kg, and most recent weight recorded on 2/8 is 4880 kg (~15g/day).  This is improved from prior admission, where he was noted to only be gaining ~9g/day.     Most recent feeding regimen was 660 ml/day goal on Goodstart 24 kcal/oz, and family was working on transitioning to Alimentum 24 kcal/oz.  He takes about 100ml every 3 hours. He has started to refuse the Alimentum all together, so mom went has been supplementing him with fortified breast milk for the past 24hrs, but his intake is far less than usual. His mother ultimately reached out on yesterday (2/15) stating that they are now open to moving forward with tube feeding given Cameron's inability to gain adequate weight at home. On the day of admission, mother reports that Cameron ate only 280 mL yesterday and 145 mL today. He is still producing 6-8 wet diapers and 2 stools each day. He has no sick symptoms or sick contacts. No issues with sleep, mother wakes him every three hours to meet feeding goals. No diarrhea/constipation. Mother not concerned about discomfort/pain.

At this time, the cause of Cameron's failure to thrive is unclear; he has normal anatomy, a normal preliminary genetic work-up and negative GI evaluation.  Optimal weight gain for Cameron is 30g/day, yet despite optimization of calories & feeding regimen at home, Cameron has only gained ~15g/day.  He requires admission for feeding tube placement, feeding advance, and close nutritional monitoring/optimization.      Failure to Thrive   - NG placement on admission  - Consult GI, appreciate recs:  - goal 660 mL each day  - q3 hr 95ml MBM w/ Gerber Good Start 24kcal/oz PO + gavage with overnight break for 6hrs  - follow up outpatient for further diet optimization  - Appreciate RD recs regarding initial formula choice  - Daily weights  - Consider touching base with gastroenterology & genetics while patient is admitted if any additional workup is indicated     Reflux  - Continue famotidine    Dispo planning  - Appreciate case management help/involvement with tube feeding supplies   - Plan for discharge 2/17 given good outpatient follow up      I have discussed my assessment and plan with the attending physician, Dr. Gold .

I personally performed the physical exam and medical decision making.  I have reviewed and agree with all of the medical student and resident/fellow documentation including the history, exam, medical decision making and findings, with the addition and/or exception of items documented below.   Cameron is a 4 mo term baby who has had ongoing failure to gain weight nearly since birth. He has had multiple hospitalizations and an extensive workup, yet weight gain at home remains challenging despite best attempts by parents. Increasingly over past few days has had some bottle refusal and concerning signs for feeding aversion. Parents are understandably exhausted and wishing to proceed with NGT placement. On exam, prominent forehead with small and soft AF. Heart/lung exams normal. Belly benign. Good tone, social smile, able to bear weight on legs, minimal head lag. Unclear etiology of FTT as he has been getting very calorically dense feeds at home and yet with suboptimal weight gain. Will re-engage genetics to see if additional workup is warranted given persistent FTT. Wiill also consult GI who has recommended admission. Plan for NGT placement, and teaching, and hopefully discharge home in coming days once completed.  Jessica May Gold, MD"
